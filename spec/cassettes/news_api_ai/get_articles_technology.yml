        "title":"Ripple CEO Predicts Bitcoin''s Meteoric Rise by 2026", "body":"Solana''s
        President sees potential for $100,000 Bitcoin, but expects volatility.\n\nSummarize
        the content using AI\n\nChatGPT\n\nGrok\n\nDuring the Binance Blockchain Week,
        Ripple $2 CEO Brad Garlinghouse forecasted a remarkable ascent for Bitcoin
        $92,985 by the end of 2026, expecting it to hit $180,000. Meanwhile, Binance
        CEO Richard Teng, who was also present, avoided setting a price target, instead
        focusing on long-term growth. Additionally, Solana $144 Foundation''s President
        Lily Liu speculated that Bitcoin would trade above $100,000. Currently, the
        largest cryptocurrency is valued at around $93,000, significantly below its
        record high of $126,000 from just two months ago.\n\nContentsBrad Garlinghouse''s
        Bold Price ForecastDiverse Perspectives from Crypto Leaders Brad Garlinghouse''s
        Bold Price Forecast\n\nAt the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, Brad Garlinghouse
        expressed confidence that Bitcoin would experience a robust upward trend within
        the next two years. The Ripple CEO attributed this anticipated growth to factors
        such as global inflationary pressures, rising institutional interest, and
        the introduction of new ETFs in the market. His prediction of $180,000 reflects
        his strong belief in the market''s potential.\n\nAccording to Garlinghouse,
        Bitcoin is poised to become more than a mere investment vehicle by 2026, assuming
        a more prominent role in the global financial system. He emphasized that as
        blockchain technology matures, investors'' perspectives on cryptocurrencies
        are evolving. Consequently, he projected that Bitcoin will feature more prominently
        on corporate balance sheets, reinforcing its status as digital gold.\n\nDiverse
        Perspectives from Crypto Leaders\n\nIn the same panel, Binance CEO Richard
        Teng refrained from sharing any price predictions, underlining his commitment
        to long-term strategies. Teng stated that the market is still in its early
        stages, with his primary focus being steady growth and regulatory compliance.
        He stressed the importance of strengthening technology and user trust over
        reacting to short-term market fluctuations.\n\nSolana Foundation''s President
        Lily Liu offered a more cautious outlook. She acknowledged the possibility
        of Bitcoin surpassing the $100,000 threshold by 2026 but warned of continued
        high volatility. Liu pointed out that recovery signals in the market and new
        capital inflows into the ecosystem will be pivotal factors supporting Bitcoin''s
        mid-term performance.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter

        "title":"IT and auto lift markets off lows as rupee slide keeps trade cautious",
        "body":"Through the morning, the tone remained hesitant. A record low for
        the rupee added to the caution, prompting traders to stay defensive in sectors
        sensitive to currency swings. Despite the weakness, select pockets of buying
        helped stabilise the market. As of about 1:15 PM the BSE Sensex was hovering
        near 85,438 points and the NSE Nifty 50 was trading close to 26,084, showing
        a modest recovery from the morning slump.\n\nIT stocks in particular saw renewed
        interest, driven by expectations that a weaker rupee could support earnings
        in the coming quarters. Auto counters also managed to find strength, helping
        offset declines in energy, metals and banking.\n\nBy midday, the benchmarks
        recovered part of their early losses as investors stepped in to buy quality
        stocks at lower levels. The rebound was modest but steady, reflecting a willingness
        among domestic institutional investors to support the market even as foreign
        outflows continued. The broader indices, however, lacked clear direction,
        and mid- and small-cap shares displayed uneven movement, with gains in technology
        and consumer stocks partly overshadowed by weakness in cyclicals.\n\nIn the
        second half of the session, markets held on to the recovery but did not gain
        enough momentum to turn decisively higher. Traders remained wary of global
        uncertainties, including shifting expectations on interest rates in major
        economies and the near-term volatility in crude oil prices. Attention also
        stayed fixed on domestic macro signals, particularly the rupee''s trajectory
        and the evolving stance of the Reserve Bank of India ahead of upcoming policy
        updates.\n\nBy late afternoon, the Sensex and Nifty were trading slightly
        above the day''s lows, supported mainly by technology, auto and select financial
        names. However, the overall mood stayed guarded. Market participants preferred
        to wait for clearer cues before taking large positions, and intraday movements
        reflected a blend of bargain hunting and profit-taking.\n\nThe session ultimately
        closed with mixed undertones: mild strength in a few heavyweight sectors,
        persistent pressure from global and currency-related factors, and a broader
        market that remained hesitant to break out either way. Thursday''s trade illustrated
        a market that is stabilising after recent volatility but still searching for
        a firm directional trigger.", "source":{"uri":"newindianexpress.com", "dataType":"news",

        "title":"As Hochul Considers an A.I. Bill, Its Sponsor Throws Her a Fund-Raiser",
        "body":"It was only a few days after announcing his first run for Congress,
        and Assemblyman Alex Bores was already gathering big money from donors.\n\nAt
        a Midtown Manhattan restaurant, Mr. Bores was a co-host of a fund-raiser that
        attracted a room full of software engineers and experts in artificial intelligence,
        many of whom support an A.I.-related bill passed by the New York State Legislature
        in June that was sponsored by Mr. Bores.\n\nThe event on Oct. 30 netted nearly
        $250,000 in political contributions, according to four people familiar with
        the matter. The money did not go to Mr. Bores -- it went to the re-election
        campaign of Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has until Dec. 31 to decide whether to
        sign, modify or veto Mr. Bores''s bill.\n\nIt was unusual for a young second-term
        assemblyman to host such an event for the governor, and even more atypical
        that Mr. Bores would have a bill before the governor, according to Blair Horner,
        the senior policy adviser at the New York Public Interest Research Group.\n\n\"There
        are no real restrictions on those who want to make donations who have business
        before the governor,\" Mr. Horner said. \"New York''s system has improved,
        but it''s still the Wild West in terms of fund-raising.\"\n\nThe campaign
        windfall to Ms. Hochul signals the importance of the A.I. bill, as lawmakers
        around the country grapple with what type of guardrails might be needed for
        a rapidly advancing technology. It also underscores the willingness of stakeholders
        to spend heavily to influence potential legislation.\n\n\"The tech sector
        is increasingly the biggest economic growth sector here, so it only stands
        to reason that you would only see this dynamic at play in politics as well,\"
        said Julie Samuels, the president of TECH:NYC, an industry association.\n\nIn
        California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in September that forces the most
        advanced A.I. companies to report safety protocols and the greatest risks
        their technologies pose.\n\nThese fights in state capitals have taken on an
        increased importance in the absence of federal standards around the safe development
        of the most advanced artificial intelligence models. At the same time, the
        Trump administration and some congressional Republicans have sought to prohibit
        states from regulating the technology.\n\nThe bill in New York, known as the
        Responsible Artificial Intelligence Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, would
        require larger firms developing A.I. models to formulate and publicize safety
        plans for their most advanced products.\n\nIf it becomes law, the legislation,
        sponsored in the State Senate by Senator Andrew Gounardes, would force companies
        to disclose \"major security incidents\" such as when the models steal or
        engage \"in behavior other than at the request of a user.\"\n\nA.I. companies
        and their financial backers took sides. Bloomberg Industry reported over the
        summer that large several venture capital firms were spending about $40,000
        a month to shape or kill the legislation. Ms. Samuels said her group had concerns
        about the bill''s current language, and she has conveyed them to Ms. Hochul.\n\nThe
        hope, Ms. Samuels added, is that changes to the RAISE Act''s transparency
        provisions can be more closely aligned with the rules recently adopted in
        California, so there can be a single framework of compliance in two of America''s
        largest states.\n\nMoney has also flowed to and against Mr. Bores''s nascent
        campaign to replace Representative Jerrold Nadler, the former House Judiciary
        chairman who is not seeking re-election. In the first 15 hours following the
        announcement of his campaign launch, Mr. Bores disclosed raising about $1.2
        million, nearly twice as much as his closest competitors. It''s unclear where
        the bulk of the money came from; disclosures for this period won''t be released
        until next year.\n\nHis foes have taken note. A bipartisan super PAC, funded
        so far with about $100 million from the founders of Open AI and Andreessen
        Horowitz, a venture capital firm, among others, has targeted Mr. Bores and
        said it would spend at least $10 million against him.\n\nThe New York Times
        reported last week that a group of people who work in and around the A.I.
        industry and fear what will happen if it is unregulated are hoping to raise
        at least $50 million to act as a counterweight and back candidates, including
        Mr. Bores.\n\nMs. Hochul has met with a number of the sector''s leading figures
        and secured about $340 million in state funds for \"Empire A.I.,\" a public-private
        partnership aimed at making New York a key player in artificial intelligence
        research. She has also said there needs to be a balance between innovation
        and safety when it comes to these new technologies.\n\nHer efforts to place
        New York at the center of this growing field comes as she gears up for a primary
        fight against Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and a likely general election battle
        against Representative Elise Stefanik, a pro-Trump Republican. The governor
        has raised about $4 million for her re-election in the first half of 2025,
        according to state disclosures, and has about $17.5 million cash on hand.\n\n\"Governor
        Hochul evaluates all legislation based on the merits and makes determinations
        solely on what is best for New Yorkers,\" Kara Cumoletti, a spokeswoman for
        Ms. Hochul, said in a statement.\n\nThe battles over A.I. regulation have
        also opened a spigot of campaign cash for local politicians like Mr. Bores,
        34, who joined the State Assembly in 2023 after working for several technology
        firms including Palantir, which does extensive work for the federal government.\n\nMr.
        Bores said in an interview that Ms. Hochul has a \"tough re-election coming
        up\" and he chose to help raise money for her because she is one of the \"most
        forward-looking governors on A.I. in the country.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of
        money being spent against any A.I. regulations in general, and it''s being
        done to overcome tremendous popular support for these provisions,\" Mr. Bores
        said. \"It''s not surprising that, of the people who support some regulation,
        some of them might also be interested in supporting candidates willing to
        stand up against big tech.\"\n\nMr. Bores has cultivated a similar network
        of donors. Many are part of the effective altruism movement, which is made
        up of activists who are among other things concerned about the safety of A.I.
        The ideology rose to prominence largely through the efforts of Sam Bankman-Fried,
        the founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange who was sentenced to 25 years
        in prison after stealing billions of dollars from customers.\n\nMany of the
        donors invited to the Hochul fund-raiser were proponents of effective altruism
        and had expressed concerns about the proliferation of unregulated A.I.\n\n\"This
        is one of the few cases where the call is coming from inside the building,\"
        Nate Soares, an A.I. researcher who was a co-author of a New York Times best-selling
        book about the subject. He was invited to the Hochul fund-raiser and has given
        to candidates from both parties whose views of A.I. align with his, including
        $1,000 to Ms. Hochul.\n\n\"A lot of people are donating money to politicians
        who are opposed by these $200 million PACs. A lot them are people who work
        in the industry or used to, and think this is really dangerous,\" he added.
        \"You have a lot of people saying that Big Oil is doing bad stuff, but you
        don''t usually have people at oil companies saying, ''This stuff is scary.''\"\n\nMr.
        Bores''s co-host of Ms. Hochul''s fund-raiser was Jack O''Donnell, a longtime
        lobbyist whose clients include the Secure AI Project, a San Francisco advocacy
        group run by a proponent of effective altruism who used to work with Mr. Bankman-Fried.
        The organization supports the RAISE Act and is pushing to pass similar bills
        around the country.\n\n.\n\nBoth Mr. O''Donnell and Mr. Bores solicited donations
        as well for the campaign committees controlled by the State Assembly Democrats
        and State Democrats. Several of the people who had been invited to the Hochul
        fund-raiser gave a combined $55,000 to these committees in the run-up to the
        bill''s passage.\n\n\"This is an ecosystem of people who really are engaged
        in the industry and believe in it but also are frightened by it,\" Mr. O''Donnell
        said.\n\nTheodore Schleifer contributed reporting.\n\nBenjamin Oreskes is

        as Market Sentiment Falls; EV Outlook and Profits Weaken While New-Vehicle
        Inventory Grows", "body":"Dealer sentiment fell sharply in Q4, with both current
        and future market indices well below the positive threshold, as franchised
        and independent dealers alike signaled widespread caution.\n\nCustomer traffic
        and profitability reached new lows, with franchised dealers experiencing the
        steepest declines and independents also reporting significant pressure from
        rising costs and weaker demand.\n\nThe outlook for electric vehicles deteriorated
        further, especially among franchised dealers, as future EV sales and leasing
        sentiment dropped to new lows following the expiration of key tax credits.\n\nATLANTA,
        Dec. 3, 2025 \/PRNewswire\/ -- The Q4 Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index
        (CADSI) reveals a significant decline in dealer confidence as economic and
        market challenges persist. Market sentiment for both current and future conditions
        fell below the positive threshold in the fourth quarter, signaling caution
        as dealers face rising costs, higher prices and economic uncertainty, all
        contributing to weaker demand.\n\n\"Dealers are signaling caution as 2025
        ends,\" said Mark Strand, deputy chief economist at Cox Automotive. \"Persistent
        economic uncertainty and fading consumer confidence are weighing on sentiment.
        Compared to the rest of the year, the current market feels like it''s running
        out of gas. As we look ahead at 2026, renewed market momentum is entirely
        possible, especially if we get material interest-rate relief and a rebound
        in consumer confidence.\"\n\nKey Findings from Q4 2025 CADSI\n\nMarket Sentiment
        Drops Sharply: Current market index fell to 38 (from 43 in Q3), and future
        outlook declined to 42 (from 46), both well below the positive threshold of
        50. Franchised dealers reported a current market index of 47, notably higher
        than independents at 35, but both groups saw declines and remain below the
        positive threshold, reflecting widespread caution.\n\nCustomer Traffic Hits
        Record Lows: Overall traffic dropped to 31, with in-person traffic at 29 and
        digital at 40. The decline in customer traffic was especially pronounced for
        franchised dealers, with in-person and digital traffic both reaching all-time
        lows, while independent dealers also saw weak but less severe declines.\n\nProfitability
        Under Pressure: Profit sentiment declined to 36 overall, with franchised dealers
        at 44 and independents at 33, reflecting margin compression from rising costs
        and softer demand. The profitability gap between franchised and independent
        dealers persisted, with independents experiencing a more pronounced impact.\n\nSales
        Environment Weakens: New-vehicle sales sentiment fell to 49 and used-vehicle
        sales to 42, both below 50, indicating a challenging retail environment. Franchised
        dealers saw new-vehicle sales sentiment fall to 49 and used-vehicle sales
        to 53, while independent dealers reported even lower used-vehicle sales sentiment
        at 39, highlighting tougher conditions for independents.\n\nInventory Mixed:
        New-vehicle inventory increased slightly to 59, while overall used inventory
        remains tight at 43. Franchised dealers view their new-vehicle inventory as
        growing (59), while independent dealers continued to face tight used inventory
        (41), limiting their ability to meet demand.\n\nEconomic Sentiment Declines:
        The economy index dropped to 39 from 43 in Q3, reinforcing concerns about
        macro headwinds. Both franchised (44) and independent dealers (37) saw economic
        sentiment decline, but independents expressed greater concern about macroeconomic
        headwinds.\n\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Outlook Slumps: Overall, dealer sentiment
        regarding the future of electric vehicle sales and leasing declined sharply
        in Q4, reflecting growing uncertainty and diminished optimism for the segment.
        Among franchised dealers, future EV sales sentiment dropped significantly
        to 24 (from 33 in Q3), and EV leasing sentiment fell to 27 (from 36), highlighting
        the most pronounced decline and the impact of expiring tax credits. Independent
        dealers continued to report lower engagement and less optimism in the EV segment,
        with sentiment remaining subdued and little change from previous quarters.\n\nQ4
        closes a turbulent year for automotive retail. After a brief tariff-fueled
        surge in Q2 and a spike in EV sales in Q3, the market has begun to show signs
        of slowing in Q4. Dealer sentiment has declined as the market slows, but if
        consumer confidence improves and auto loan rates start to trend lower, momentum
        and sentiment could recover in the first half of 2026.\n\nCox Automotive Dealer
        Sentiment Index Methodology\n\nThe Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index (CADSI)
        is derived from a quarterly survey issued to a representative sample of franchised
        and independent auto dealers across the United States. The Q4 2025 CADSI is
        based on responses from 919 dealers, including 492 franchised and 427 independent
        dealers.\n\nThe survey, conducted from Oct. 22 to Nov. 6, 2025, measures dealer
        perceptions of current retail auto sales and sales expectations for the next
        three months as \"strong,\" \"average,\" or \"weak.\" Responses are weighted
        by dealership type and sales volume to represent the national dealer population.
        Indices are calculated by assigning values to responses: 100 for strong\/increasing,
        50 for average\/stable, and 0 for weak\/decreasing. Respondents who select
        \"don''t know\" are excluded from the index calculation. The reported metrics
        have a margin of error of +\/- 3.23%.\n\nRead the full commentary and download
