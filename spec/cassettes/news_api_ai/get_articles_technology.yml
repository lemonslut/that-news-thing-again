        "title":"Ripple CEO Predicts Bitcoin''s Meteoric Rise by 2026", "body":"Solana''s
        President sees potential for $100,000 Bitcoin, but expects volatility.\n\nSummarize
        the content using AI\n\nChatGPT\n\nGrok\n\nDuring the Binance Blockchain Week,
        Ripple $2 CEO Brad Garlinghouse forecasted a remarkable ascent for Bitcoin
        $92,985 by the end of 2026, expecting it to hit $180,000. Meanwhile, Binance
        CEO Richard Teng, who was also present, avoided setting a price target, instead
        focusing on long-term growth. Additionally, Solana $144 Foundation''s President
        Lily Liu speculated that Bitcoin would trade above $100,000. Currently, the
        largest cryptocurrency is valued at around $93,000, significantly below its
        record high of $126,000 from just two months ago.\n\nContentsBrad Garlinghouse''s
        Bold Price ForecastDiverse Perspectives from Crypto Leaders Brad Garlinghouse''s
        Bold Price Forecast\n\nAt the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, Brad Garlinghouse
        expressed confidence that Bitcoin would experience a robust upward trend within
        the next two years. The Ripple CEO attributed this anticipated growth to factors
        such as global inflationary pressures, rising institutional interest, and
        the introduction of new ETFs in the market. His prediction of $180,000 reflects
        his strong belief in the market''s potential.\n\nAccording to Garlinghouse,
        Bitcoin is poised to become more than a mere investment vehicle by 2026, assuming
        a more prominent role in the global financial system. He emphasized that as
        blockchain technology matures, investors'' perspectives on cryptocurrencies
        are evolving. Consequently, he projected that Bitcoin will feature more prominently
        on corporate balance sheets, reinforcing its status as digital gold.\n\nDiverse
        Perspectives from Crypto Leaders\n\nIn the same panel, Binance CEO Richard
        Teng refrained from sharing any price predictions, underlining his commitment
        to long-term strategies. Teng stated that the market is still in its early
        stages, with his primary focus being steady growth and regulatory compliance.
        He stressed the importance of strengthening technology and user trust over
        reacting to short-term market fluctuations.\n\nSolana Foundation''s President
        Lily Liu offered a more cautious outlook. She acknowledged the possibility
        of Bitcoin surpassing the $100,000 threshold by 2026 but warned of continued
        high volatility. Liu pointed out that recovery signals in the market and new
        capital inflows into the ecosystem will be pivotal factors supporting Bitcoin''s
        mid-term performance.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter

        "title":"IT and auto lift markets off lows as rupee slide keeps trade cautious",
        "body":"Through the morning, the tone remained hesitant. A record low for
        the rupee added to the caution, prompting traders to stay defensive in sectors
        sensitive to currency swings. Despite the weakness, select pockets of buying
        helped stabilise the market. As of about 1:15 PM the BSE Sensex was hovering
        near 85,438 points and the NSE Nifty 50 was trading close to 26,084, showing
        a modest recovery from the morning slump.\n\nIT stocks in particular saw renewed
        interest, driven by expectations that a weaker rupee could support earnings
        in the coming quarters. Auto counters also managed to find strength, helping
        offset declines in energy, metals and banking.\n\nBy midday, the benchmarks
        recovered part of their early losses as investors stepped in to buy quality
        stocks at lower levels. The rebound was modest but steady, reflecting a willingness
        among domestic institutional investors to support the market even as foreign
        outflows continued. The broader indices, however, lacked clear direction,
        and mid- and small-cap shares displayed uneven movement, with gains in technology
        and consumer stocks partly overshadowed by weakness in cyclicals.\n\nIn the
        second half of the session, markets held on to the recovery but did not gain
        enough momentum to turn decisively higher. Traders remained wary of global
        uncertainties, including shifting expectations on interest rates in major
        economies and the near-term volatility in crude oil prices. Attention also
        stayed fixed on domestic macro signals, particularly the rupee''s trajectory
        and the evolving stance of the Reserve Bank of India ahead of upcoming policy
        updates.\n\nBy late afternoon, the Sensex and Nifty were trading slightly
        above the day''s lows, supported mainly by technology, auto and select financial
        names. However, the overall mood stayed guarded. Market participants preferred
        to wait for clearer cues before taking large positions, and intraday movements
        reflected a blend of bargain hunting and profit-taking.\n\nThe session ultimately
        closed with mixed undertones: mild strength in a few heavyweight sectors,
        persistent pressure from global and currency-related factors, and a broader
        market that remained hesitant to break out either way. Thursday''s trade illustrated
        a market that is stabilising after recent volatility but still searching for
        a firm directional trigger.", "source":{"uri":"newindianexpress.com", "dataType":"news",

        "title":"As Hochul Considers an A.I. Bill, Its Sponsor Throws Her a Fund-Raiser",
        "body":"It was only a few days after announcing his first run for Congress,
        and Assemblyman Alex Bores was already gathering big money from donors.\n\nAt
        a Midtown Manhattan restaurant, Mr. Bores was a co-host of a fund-raiser that
        attracted a room full of software engineers and experts in artificial intelligence,
        many of whom support an A.I.-related bill passed by the New York State Legislature
        in June that was sponsored by Mr. Bores.\n\nThe event on Oct. 30 netted nearly
        $250,000 in political contributions, according to four people familiar with
        the matter. The money did not go to Mr. Bores -- it went to the re-election
        campaign of Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has until Dec. 31 to decide whether to
        sign, modify or veto Mr. Bores''s bill.\n\nIt was unusual for a young second-term
        assemblyman to host such an event for the governor, and even more atypical
        that Mr. Bores would have a bill before the governor, according to Blair Horner,
        the senior policy adviser at the New York Public Interest Research Group.\n\n\"There
        are no real restrictions on those who want to make donations who have business
        before the governor,\" Mr. Horner said. \"New York''s system has improved,
        but it''s still the Wild West in terms of fund-raising.\"\n\nThe campaign
        windfall to Ms. Hochul signals the importance of the A.I. bill, as lawmakers
        around the country grapple with what type of guardrails might be needed for
        a rapidly advancing technology. It also underscores the willingness of stakeholders
        to spend heavily to influence potential legislation.\n\n\"The tech sector
        is increasingly the biggest economic growth sector here, so it only stands
        to reason that you would only see this dynamic at play in politics as well,\"
        said Julie Samuels, the president of TECH:NYC, an industry association.\n\nIn
        California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in September that forces the most
        advanced A.I. companies to report safety protocols and the greatest risks
        their technologies pose.\n\nThese fights in state capitals have taken on an
        increased importance in the absence of federal standards around the safe development
        of the most advanced artificial intelligence models. At the same time, the
        Trump administration and some congressional Republicans have sought to prohibit
        states from regulating the technology.\n\nThe bill in New York, known as the
        Responsible Artificial Intelligence Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, would
        require larger firms developing A.I. models to formulate and publicize safety
        plans for their most advanced products.\n\nIf it becomes law, the legislation,
        sponsored in the State Senate by Senator Andrew Gounardes, would force companies
        to disclose \"major security incidents\" such as when the models steal or
        engage \"in behavior other than at the request of a user.\"\n\nA.I. companies
        and their financial backers took sides. Bloomberg Industry reported over the
        summer that large several venture capital firms were spending about $40,000
        a month to shape or kill the legislation. Ms. Samuels said her group had concerns
        about the bill''s current language, and she has conveyed them to Ms. Hochul.\n\nThe
        hope, Ms. Samuels added, is that changes to the RAISE Act''s transparency
        provisions can be more closely aligned with the rules recently adopted in
        California, so there can be a single framework of compliance in two of America''s
        largest states.\n\nMoney has also flowed to and against Mr. Bores''s nascent
        campaign to replace Representative Jerrold Nadler, the former House Judiciary
        chairman who is not seeking re-election. In the first 15 hours following the
        announcement of his campaign launch, Mr. Bores disclosed raising about $1.2
        million, nearly twice as much as his closest competitors. It''s unclear where
        the bulk of the money came from; disclosures for this period won''t be released
        until next year.\n\nHis foes have taken note. A bipartisan super PAC, funded
        so far with about $100 million from the founders of Open AI and Andreessen
        Horowitz, a venture capital firm, among others, has targeted Mr. Bores and
        said it would spend at least $10 million against him.\n\nThe New York Times
        reported last week that a group of people who work in and around the A.I.
        industry and fear what will happen if it is unregulated are hoping to raise
        at least $50 million to act as a counterweight and back candidates, including
        Mr. Bores.\n\nMs. Hochul has met with a number of the sector''s leading figures
        and secured about $340 million in state funds for \"Empire A.I.,\" a public-private
        partnership aimed at making New York a key player in artificial intelligence
        research. She has also said there needs to be a balance between innovation
        and safety when it comes to these new technologies.\n\nHer efforts to place
        New York at the center of this growing field comes as she gears up for a primary
        fight against Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and a likely general election battle
        against Representative Elise Stefanik, a pro-Trump Republican. The governor
        has raised about $4 million for her re-election in the first half of 2025,
        according to state disclosures, and has about $17.5 million cash on hand.\n\n\"Governor
        Hochul evaluates all legislation based on the merits and makes determinations
        solely on what is best for New Yorkers,\" Kara Cumoletti, a spokeswoman for
        Ms. Hochul, said in a statement.\n\nThe battles over A.I. regulation have
        also opened a spigot of campaign cash for local politicians like Mr. Bores,
        34, who joined the State Assembly in 2023 after working for several technology
        firms including Palantir, which does extensive work for the federal government.\n\nMr.
        Bores said in an interview that Ms. Hochul has a \"tough re-election coming
        up\" and he chose to help raise money for her because she is one of the \"most
        forward-looking governors on A.I. in the country.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of
        money being spent against any A.I. regulations in general, and it''s being
        done to overcome tremendous popular support for these provisions,\" Mr. Bores
        said. \"It''s not surprising that, of the people who support some regulation,
        some of them might also be interested in supporting candidates willing to
        stand up against big tech.\"\n\nMr. Bores has cultivated a similar network
        of donors. Many are part of the effective altruism movement, which is made
        up of activists who are among other things concerned about the safety of A.I.
        The ideology rose to prominence largely through the efforts of Sam Bankman-Fried,
        the founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange who was sentenced to 25 years
        in prison after stealing billions of dollars from customers.\n\nMany of the
        donors invited to the Hochul fund-raiser were proponents of effective altruism
        and had expressed concerns about the proliferation of unregulated A.I.\n\n\"This
        is one of the few cases where the call is coming from inside the building,\"
        Nate Soares, an A.I. researcher who was a co-author of a New York Times best-selling
        book about the subject. He was invited to the Hochul fund-raiser and has given
        to candidates from both parties whose views of A.I. align with his, including
        $1,000 to Ms. Hochul.\n\n\"A lot of people are donating money to politicians
        who are opposed by these $200 million PACs. A lot them are people who work
        in the industry or used to, and think this is really dangerous,\" he added.
        \"You have a lot of people saying that Big Oil is doing bad stuff, but you
        don''t usually have people at oil companies saying, ''This stuff is scary.''\"\n\nMr.
        Bores''s co-host of Ms. Hochul''s fund-raiser was Jack O''Donnell, a longtime
        lobbyist whose clients include the Secure AI Project, a San Francisco advocacy
        group run by a proponent of effective altruism who used to work with Mr. Bankman-Fried.
        The organization supports the RAISE Act and is pushing to pass similar bills
        around the country.\n\n.\n\nBoth Mr. O''Donnell and Mr. Bores solicited donations
        as well for the campaign committees controlled by the State Assembly Democrats
        and State Democrats. Several of the people who had been invited to the Hochul
        fund-raiser gave a combined $55,000 to these committees in the run-up to the
        bill''s passage.\n\n\"This is an ecosystem of people who really are engaged
        in the industry and believe in it but also are frightened by it,\" Mr. O''Donnell
        said.\n\nTheodore Schleifer contributed reporting.\n\nBenjamin Oreskes is

        as Market Sentiment Falls; EV Outlook and Profits Weaken While New-Vehicle
        Inventory Grows", "body":"Dealer sentiment fell sharply in Q4, with both current
        and future market indices well below the positive threshold, as franchised
        and independent dealers alike signaled widespread caution.\n\nCustomer traffic
        and profitability reached new lows, with franchised dealers experiencing the
        steepest declines and independents also reporting significant pressure from
        rising costs and weaker demand.\n\nThe outlook for electric vehicles deteriorated
        further, especially among franchised dealers, as future EV sales and leasing
        sentiment dropped to new lows following the expiration of key tax credits.\n\nATLANTA,
        Dec. 3, 2025 \/PRNewswire\/ -- The Q4 Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index
        (CADSI) reveals a significant decline in dealer confidence as economic and
        market challenges persist. Market sentiment for both current and future conditions
        fell below the positive threshold in the fourth quarter, signaling caution
        as dealers face rising costs, higher prices and economic uncertainty, all
        contributing to weaker demand.\n\n\"Dealers are signaling caution as 2025
        ends,\" said Mark Strand, deputy chief economist at Cox Automotive. \"Persistent
        economic uncertainty and fading consumer confidence are weighing on sentiment.
        Compared to the rest of the year, the current market feels like it''s running
        out of gas. As we look ahead at 2026, renewed market momentum is entirely
        possible, especially if we get material interest-rate relief and a rebound
        in consumer confidence.\"\n\nKey Findings from Q4 2025 CADSI\n\nMarket Sentiment
        Drops Sharply: Current market index fell to 38 (from 43 in Q3), and future
        outlook declined to 42 (from 46), both well below the positive threshold of
        50. Franchised dealers reported a current market index of 47, notably higher
        than independents at 35, but both groups saw declines and remain below the
        positive threshold, reflecting widespread caution.\n\nCustomer Traffic Hits
        Record Lows: Overall traffic dropped to 31, with in-person traffic at 29 and
        digital at 40. The decline in customer traffic was especially pronounced for
        franchised dealers, with in-person and digital traffic both reaching all-time
        lows, while independent dealers also saw weak but less severe declines.\n\nProfitability
        Under Pressure: Profit sentiment declined to 36 overall, with franchised dealers
        at 44 and independents at 33, reflecting margin compression from rising costs
        and softer demand. The profitability gap between franchised and independent
        dealers persisted, with independents experiencing a more pronounced impact.\n\nSales
        Environment Weakens: New-vehicle sales sentiment fell to 49 and used-vehicle
        sales to 42, both below 50, indicating a challenging retail environment. Franchised
        dealers saw new-vehicle sales sentiment fall to 49 and used-vehicle sales
        to 53, while independent dealers reported even lower used-vehicle sales sentiment
        at 39, highlighting tougher conditions for independents.\n\nInventory Mixed:
        New-vehicle inventory increased slightly to 59, while overall used inventory
        remains tight at 43. Franchised dealers view their new-vehicle inventory as
        growing (59), while independent dealers continued to face tight used inventory
        (41), limiting their ability to meet demand.\n\nEconomic Sentiment Declines:
        The economy index dropped to 39 from 43 in Q3, reinforcing concerns about
        macro headwinds. Both franchised (44) and independent dealers (37) saw economic
        sentiment decline, but independents expressed greater concern about macroeconomic
        headwinds.\n\nElectric Vehicle (EV) Outlook Slumps: Overall, dealer sentiment
        regarding the future of electric vehicle sales and leasing declined sharply
        in Q4, reflecting growing uncertainty and diminished optimism for the segment.
        Among franchised dealers, future EV sales sentiment dropped significantly
        to 24 (from 33 in Q3), and EV leasing sentiment fell to 27 (from 36), highlighting
        the most pronounced decline and the impact of expiring tax credits. Independent
        dealers continued to report lower engagement and less optimism in the EV segment,
        with sentiment remaining subdued and little change from previous quarters.\n\nQ4
        closes a turbulent year for automotive retail. After a brief tariff-fueled
        surge in Q2 and a spike in EV sales in Q3, the market has begun to show signs
        of slowing in Q4. Dealer sentiment has declined as the market slows, but if
        consumer confidence improves and auto loan rates start to trend lower, momentum
        and sentiment could recover in the first half of 2026.\n\nCox Automotive Dealer
        Sentiment Index Methodology\n\nThe Cox Automotive Dealer Sentiment Index (CADSI)
        is derived from a quarterly survey issued to a representative sample of franchised
        and independent auto dealers across the United States. The Q4 2025 CADSI is
        based on responses from 919 dealers, including 492 franchised and 427 independent
        dealers.\n\nThe survey, conducted from Oct. 22 to Nov. 6, 2025, measures dealer
        perceptions of current retail auto sales and sales expectations for the next
        three months as \"strong,\" \"average,\" or \"weak.\" Responses are weighted
        by dealership type and sales volume to represent the national dealer population.
        Indices are calculated by assigning values to responses: 100 for strong\/increasing,
        50 for average\/stable, and 0 for weak\/decreasing. Respondents who select
        \"don''t know\" are excluded from the index calculation. The reported metrics
        have a margin of error of +\/- 3.23%.\n\nRead the full commentary and download

        "title":"Dealerships Can''t Seem to Sell These 2024 Car Models at All", "body":"Ever
        wonder which brand-new cars are gathering dust on dealer lots across America?
        iSeeCars did a deep dive into more than 2.6 million new car listings across
        the United States, revealing some surprising answers.\n\nThe data shows the
        percentage of 2024 inventory still sitting unsold, and the results paint an
        interesting picture of what today''s buyers are actually looking for. From
        luxury SUVs to sports cars, these twelve models are having a tougher time
        finding homes than dealers probably anticipated.\n\nSome of the names might
        surprise you, while others make perfect sense once you consider pricing, timing,
        and market trends.\n\nLeading the pack with a staggering 82% of inventory
        still available, the Dodge Hornet plug-in hybrid is struggling to find its
        audience. This compact crossover arrived with plenty of expectations, bringing
        electrification to the Dodge lineup in an unexpected package.\n\nThe pricing
        sits in an awkward middle ground where buyers shopping for practicality might
        opt for less expensive options, while performance enthusiasts may not see
        the Hornet as a true Dodge muscle vehicle. The plug-in hybrid powertrain adds
        complexity and cost that many shoppers in this segment simply aren''t asking
        for.\n\nIt''s a challenging market position when your brand identity is built
        on roaring V8s and quarter-mile times.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has long been
        a cornerstone of Jeep''s lineup, but more than 70% of 2024 models remain unsold
        at an average price above $64,000. That price point puts it in direct competition
        with luxury European SUVs that offer prestigious badges and refined experiences.\n\nThe
        midsize SUV market is fiercely competitive, especially at this price point
        where buyers have dozens of well-established two-row luxury and near-luxury
        options to choose from. Jeep''s recent quality perception issues haven''t
        helped matters, as buyers spending this much want assurance their investment
        will be reliable.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee remains capable and spacious, but
        convincing buyers to choose it over established luxury competitors at this
        price requires a compelling value proposition.\n\nAlfa Romeo''s entry into
        the compact luxury crossover segment has met a lukewarm reception, with nearly
        half of the 2024 Tonale Hybrid inventory still available. The Italian brand
        brings undeniable style and driving dynamics, but the hybrid powertrain in
        a segment where buyers often prioritize either pure efficiency or pure performance
        creates an identity challenge.\n\nAt almost $52,000, shoppers have access
        to well-established German competitors with stronger dealer networks and better
        resale values. The Tonale looks fantastic and drives with characteristic Alfa
        flair, but breaking into the American market with limited brand presence remains
        an uphill battle.\n\nEnthusiasts love what Alfa Romeo represents, though convincing
        mainstream luxury buyers to take the leap is another story entirely.\n\nThe
        Malibu''s struggles reflect a broader trend: the American sedan is facing
        an existential crisis. With 31% of inventory unsold, this dependable midsize
        sedan is caught in a market that has decisively shifted toward SUVs and crossovers.\n\nChevrolet
        has already announced the Malibu''s discontinuation, which certainly doesn''t
        help sales as buyers tend to avoid models they know are being phased out.
        The pricing is reasonable and the Malibu offers solid value with good fuel
        economy and a comfortable ride.\n\nHowever, when most buyers can get into
        a Chevy Trax or Trailblazer for similar money with the added versatility of
        a crossover, the traditional sedan becomes a tougher sell.\n\nThe non-hybrid
        Dodge Hornet appears again, this time the base model with 26% of inventory
        still on lots. At nearly $32,000, this Alfa Romeo Tonale-based crossover faces
        an identity crisis within the Dodge lineup.\n\nTraditional Dodge buyers expect
        American muscle and V8 rumble, not a turbocharged four-cylinder Italian-rooted
        crossover. The Hornet offers decent performance and modern features, but it
        doesn''t fit the brand''s muscle car image that draws customers to showrooms.
        Meanwhile, buyers simply looking for a compact crossover have dozens of more
        established options to choose from.\n\nDodge is attempting to pivot toward
        a more diverse lineup, though this transition is proving challenging when
        your brand loyalty is built on a very specific type of vehicle.\n\nWhen your
        average transaction price approaches six figures, you''re competing with some
        serious luxury iron. The Grand Wagoneer L stretches the already-large Grand
        Wagoneer even further, creating a true land yacht for families who need maximum
        space.\n\nAt over $92,000, buyers at this level expect Range Rover levels
        of refinement and prestige, which represents a significant leap for the Jeep
        brand. The Grand Wagoneer L offers impressive capability and generous three-row
        seating, but the price tag puts it in rarefied air where badge perception
        matters enormously.\n\nJeep has made tremendous strides in luxury execution,
        yet convincing ultra-luxury buyers to choose a Jeep over established European
        competitors remains a formidable challenge.\n\nGenesis continues working to
        establish itself in the American luxury market, and the electric GV60 crossover
        exemplifies both the brand''s potential and its challenges. With nearly 22%
        of inventory unsold, this stylish EV offers distinctive design and impressive
        technology at a price point below comparable European EVs.\n\nThe challenge
        is brand awareness and dealer network size, as Genesis simply doesn''t have
        the visibility or accessibility of established luxury brands. The GV60 delivers
        genuine luxury and engaging driving dynamics in an eye-catching package.\n\nHowever,
        when spending nearly $58,000 on an electric vehicle, many buyers gravitate
        toward Tesla''s established Supercharger network or prestigious German alternatives
        with decades of luxury credibility.\n\nThe legendary Charger''s presence on
        this list might seem surprising given its cult following, but at nearly $60,000
        average price, we''re looking at well-equipped or performance variants. The
        Charger has enjoyed an incredible run as one of the last V8-powered sedan
        options, yet the transition to electric power looms on the horizon.\n\nBuyers
        interested in the traditional Charger experience may be waiting for deals
        as inventory clears, while those interested in the upcoming electric version
        are simply waiting for its arrival. The pricing also reflects how expensive
        these muscle sedans have become, potentially pricing out some traditional
        buyers.\n\nThe Charger remains an automotive icon, though this transitional
        moment creates uncertainty in the marketplace.\n\nThe reborn Z sports car
        brought tremendous excitement when it launched, combining retro-inspired styling
        with modern performance. However, with nearly 19% of inventory unsold at an
        average price above $53,000, the market reality for two-seater sports cars
        is challenging.\n\nThis price point puts the Z in competition with the Toyota
        Supra, Chevrolet Corvette, and various European sports cars that offer different
        flavors of performance. The Z delivers fantastic driving dynamics and that
        classic long-hood proportions that enthusiasts love, but sports car sales
        volumes are inherently limited.\n\nAdditionally, the automatic-only NISMO
        trim disappointed some purists, even though manual transmissions remain available
        on other Z trims.\n\nThe Wrangler 4xe brings electrification to Jeep''s most
        iconic nameplate, yet 18% of inventory remains unsold at an eye-watering average
        of nearly $61,000. This price reflects the technology premium for the plug-in
        hybrid system, pushing the Wrangler into luxury vehicle territory.\n\nTraditional
        Wrangler buyers often prioritize simplicity and proven off-road capability,
        while the added complexity of a PHEV system may not align with how they use
        their vehicles. The 4xe actually offers impressive off-road benefits with
        instant electric torque and silent running capability, plus daily driving
        efficiency that traditional Wranglers can''t match.\n\nHowever, convincing
        buyers to spend this much on a Wrangler requires demonstrating clear advantages
        over the less expensive conventional powertrains.\n\nHyundai''s electrified
        Tucson represents a logical evolution of the popular compact crossover, though
        14% of PHEV inventory remains available. At over $45,000, the plug-in hybrid
        commands a significant premium over the regular Tucson, which already offers
        excellent value and features.\n\nBuyers interested in electrification at this
        price point have numerous options, including fully electric vehicles that
        eliminate gas stations entirely. The Tucson PHEV makes sense for drivers who
        want electric-only commuting capability with gas backup for longer trips,
        though that specific use case represents a smaller slice of the market.\n\nHyundai''s
        rapid advancement in quality and technology is impressive, yet the price premium
        for plug-in capability remains a hurdle for value-conscious crossover shoppers.\n\nThe
        standard-length Grand Wagoneer rounds out our list with 13% of inventory unsold
        at an average price approaching $84,000. Jeep''s flagship SUV aims to reclaim
        the brand''s heritage of premium American utility vehicles with genuine luxury
        appointments.\n\nThe execution is impressive with high-quality materials,
        advanced technology, and commanding road presence that makes a statement.
        Yet at this price, buyers comparison shop against well-established luxury
        SUVs from brands with long histories of premium vehicle production.\n\nThe
        Grand Wagoneer succeeds in offering Jeep capability with upscale execution,
        though breaking into the established luxury SUV market requires time for brand
        perception to catch up with product reality.\n\nThis inventory analysis reveals
        some clear patterns about today''s automotive market. Plug-in hybrids face
        an uphill battle as buyers increasingly choose either conventional powertrains
        or fully electric vehicles, skipping the middle ground entirely.\n\nPremium
        pricing pushes vehicles into competitive territory where brand perception
        and established luxury credentials matter enormously. The data also shows
        that even beloved nameplates like the Wrangler and Charger face sales challenges
        when configurations push prices into unexpected territory.\n\nThese inventory
        levels don''t necessarily indicate bad vehicles, but rather misalignments
        between product offerings, pricing, and what buyers are actually seeking in
        today''s market.", "source":{"uri":"autos.yahoo.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Yahoo

        JAYA: To stay ahead of the monsters that target our most vulnerable, the fight
        against child predators must continue to evolve with better utilisation of
        technology and long-term psychological help for victims.\n\nBukit Aman Criminal
        Investigations Department (CID) sexual, women and child investigation division
        (D11) principal assistant director Senior Asst Comm Siti Kamsiah Hassan said
        that despite high-profile operations such as Op Cyber Guardian and Op Pedo,
        the past year showed that criminals are always changing tactics to avoid detection.\n\n\"Although
        significant progress has been made, paedophilia-related crime is dynamic,
        complex, and constantly evolving. Therefore, several aspects should be given
        emphasis in the coming year,\" she shared in an exclusive interview with The
        Star.\n\n\"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data analytics must
        be leveraged to help detect patterns of paedophilic behaviour, hidden networks,
        and new forms of technology-generated content such as deepfakes.\n\n\"Automation
        of online content monitoring can also help expedite enforcement actions,\"
        she added.\n\nAccording to Siti, behavioural science and forensic psychology
        support units are also needed to assist in offender profiling, repeat-risk
        assessment, and strengthening the quality of investigations.\n\n\"This approach
        is crucial because many paedophilia cases are closely linked to issues of
        impulse control, emotional manipulation, and past trauma,\" she said.\n\nSiti
        added that digital literacy education is also imperative and must be implemented
        on a national level.\n\n\"It should start from the schools, all the way to
        the parents.\n\n\"Preemptive prevention is the key, as many paedophilia cases
        do not start with physical touch but through online emotional manipulation,\"
        she said.\n\nSAC Siti noted that the department''s successes this year also
        showed Bukit Aman''s continuous commitment to curb paedophilia-related crimes,
        with enhanced international cooperation and higher detection capabilities
        in tracing down child sexual abuse materials (CSAM).\n\n\"International cooperation
        is more aggressive. The police enhanced partnerships within Interpol, Aseanpol
        and our overseas enforcement comrades in tracing down cross-border pedophilia
        rings, including travelling sex offenders.\n\n\"Arrests were also possible
        with the exchange of intelligence and technical support amongst our partners

        17 individuals, including four Chinese nationals, and 58 companies for running

        to siphon over Rs 1,000 crore, officials said\n\nNew Delhi: The CBI has filed
        a chargesheet against 17 people, including four Chinese nationals, and 58
        companies for their alleged roles in a transnational cyber fraud network that
        siphoned off over Rs 1,000 crore through a sprawling web of shell entities
        and digital scams, officials said on Sunday.\n\nAfter busting the racket in
        October, investigators unravelled a single, tightly coordinated syndicate
        that relied on an elaborate digital and financial infrastructure to run a
        range of frauds. These included misleading loan applications, fake investment
        schemes, Ponzi and multi-level marketing models, bogus part-time job offers
        and fraudulent online gaming platforms.\n\nAccording to the probe agency''s
        final report, the group layered the flow of illicit funds through 111 shell
        companies, routing about Rs 1,000 crore via mule accounts. One account received
        more than Rs 152 crore in a short span.\n\nThe shell companies, the CBI said,
        were incorporated using dummy directors, forged or misleading documents, fake
        addresses and false statements of business objectives.\n\n\"These shell entities
        were used to open bank accounts and merchant accounts with various payment
        gateways, enabling rapid layering and diversion of proceeds of crime,\" a
        CBI spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nInvestigators traced the origins
        of the scam to 2020, when the country was grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.
        The shell companies were allegedly incorporated at the direction of four Chinese
        handlers -- Zou Yi, Huan Liu, Weijian Liu and Guanhua Wang.\n\nTheir Indian
        associates procured identity documents from unsuspecting individuals, which
        were then used to establish the network of shell companies and mule accounts
        to launder proceeds from the scams and obscure the money trail.\n\nThe investigation
        exposed communication links and operational control that, the agency said,
        nailed the role of Chinese masterminds running the fraud network from abroad.\n\n\"Significantly,
        a UPI ID linked to the bank accounts of two Indian accused was found to be
        active in a foreign location as late as August 2025, conclusively establishing
        continued foreign control and real-time operational oversight of the fraud
        infrastructure from outside India,\" the CBI statement said.\n\nThe probe
        found that the racketeers employed a highly layered, technology-driven modus
        operandi, using Google advertisements, bulk SMS campaigns, SIM-box-based messaging
        systems, cloud infrastructure, fintech platforms and multiple mule bank accounts.\n\n\"Each
        stage of the operation -- from luring victims to collection and movement of
        funds -- was deliberately structured to conceal the identities of the actual
        controllers and evade detection by law enforcement agencies,\" the spokesperson
        said.\n\nThe chargesheet names 17 individuals, including the four Chinese
        nationals, and 58 companies.\n\nThe investigation was launched on the inputs
        from the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of
        Home Affairs, which flagged large-scale cheating of citizens through online
        investment and employment schemes, resulting in the arrest of three individuals
        in October.\n\n\"Though initially appearing as isolated complaints, detailed
        analysis by CBI revealed striking similarities in applications used, fund-flow
        patterns, payment gateways and digital footprints, pointing towards a common
        organised conspiracy,\" the agency said.\n\nFollowing the October arrests,
        the CBI conducted searches at 27 locations across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala,
        Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Haryana, seizing digital devices, documents
        and financial records that were later subjected to detailed forensic examination.",
