        On 2 features multiple divisions, including one dedicated to providing lessons
        and a competition team. (Byron Garcia \/ Break On 2)\n\nWhen students enter
        Mudd Hall on Monday nights, the first thing they hear is bachata playing through
        the speakers. The second thing they hear is the squeaking of sneakers on the
        floor as Break On 2''s Club Annex rehearses.\n\nDelila Gonzalez, a senior
        studying theatre, leads Club Annex as its captain, teaching participants how
        to dance anything from salsa and bachata to cumbia.\n\nClub Annex is only
        one of three components of USC''s Break On 2: Latin Fusion, a dance team founded
        in 2004 that also has a performance team made up of 42 members, along with
        a smaller competition team.\n\nGonzalez said she was initially hesitant about
        auditioning for Break On 2. However, after she got onto the competition team,
        she quickly fell in love with it.\n\n\"I don''t think people understand how
        communal dance can be,\" Gonzalez said. \"It sounds so cheesy, but it genuinely
        brings people together.\"\n\nAfter Break On 2 renewed her passion for Latin
        Dance, Gonzalez began teaching Latin dance to high school students in collaboration
        with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps.\n\n\"[Latin dance] essentially consumed
        my whole life.\" Gonzalez said. \"I don''t only teach it [at USC]; I also
        teach it at a high school.\"\n\nVictoria Ocampos Costa, a senior studying
        business of cinematic arts and the president of Break On 2, originally did
        not make Break On 2''s performance team. But she was accepted after attending
        Club Annex for an entire year and auditioning the following fall. Ocampos
        Costa said being part of Break On 2 has been integral to her experience at
        USC.\n\n\"I love the team so much. It''s a huge part of who I am at USC, and
        it plays a big role in my journey here over the last four years.\" Ocampos
        Costa said. \"It creates a home for a lot of people, including myself. Break
        On 2 is not a Latino-exclusive club. We have members from all different nationalities
        and places, but it becomes a home because we spend so much time together.\"\n\nKaeley
        Cooper, a senior majoring in law, history and culture as well as social sciences,
        is the competition team captain at Break On 2. Cooper said she loves the energy
        of the group''s salsa nights, where even strangers feel connected to her through
        celebrating Latin dance.\n\n\"What I gained from it [is] not only a sense
        of community and the incredible people that I''ve met through the team but
        also getting to appreciate the culture and demonstrate and expose it to a
        variety of people,\" Cooper said.\n\nEvery first Friday of the month, Break
        On 2 hosts salsa nights with live music. According to graduate student Nathan
        Justin, the longest-tenured current Break On 2 member, these salsa nights
        have been an introduction to Latin dance for many students over the years.\n\nJustin
        has been in Break On 2 for six years, and it has been his home throughout
        his entire career at USC. For him, clubs like Break On 2 matter because they
        help connect people at such a large university.\n\n\"I think it provides an
        outlet for people to meet each other,\" Justin said. \"Partner dance is a
        fantastic way for people to work together to make a dance happen, and that
        kind of teamwork naturally makes a lot of good friends.\"\n\nBella Duarte,
        a junior studying psychology, is the co-creative director of Break On 2. Duarte
        co-choreographs all of the pieces the team presents throughout the fall, as
        well as the opener for their spring showcase. Duarte said the cultural aspect
        of the dance team speaks to her most both as a choreographer and community
        member.\n\n\"It''s important to have a group such as Break On 2 because there''s
        someone who can represent a minority on campus, represent something that''s
        just so bright,\" Duarte said. \"I think whenever we enter a room, there''s
        just so much color, so much vibrance.\"\n\nDuarte joined Break On 2 because
        she was in search of a community at USC that helped her connect with her culture.\n\n\"Break
        On 2 is probably the best community I have found here on campus, because I
        feel so at home,\" Duarte said. \"They make me feel so loved, and they''ve
        helped me embrace my Mexican side of my family.\"\n\nJustin emphasized Break
        On 2''s role in celebrating Latine culture. Being able to do different types
        of dances from across Latin America has been amazing while building a community
        at USC, Justin said.\n\n\"I think a lot of us say Break On 2 is a family,
        and it really is true,\" Justin said. \"It''s been my family throughout my
        entire time at USC, so we''re all united with a love for dance, but we don''t
        just dance -- we also look out for each other.\"", "source":{"uri":"dailytrojan.com",

        RocketNews", "body":"Australia''s world-first ban requires 10 major online
        platforms to block users aged 16.By AFP and APPublished On 4 Dec 20254 Dec
        2025Click here to share on social mediashare2ShareTech giant Meta has begun
        removing minors below 16 years of age in Australia from its platforms Instagram,
        Threads and Facebook ahead of the country''s world-first youth social media
        ban.\"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be
        under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing
        and multilayered process,\" a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday.Recommended
        Stories list of 3 itemsend of listAustralia requires 10 major online platforms,
        also including TikTok and YouTube, to block underage users by December 10,
        when the new law comes into force.Companies face fines of 49.5 million Australian
        dollars ($32m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to comply.Hundreds
        of thousands of adolescents are likely to be affected by the ban, with Instagram
        alone reporting about 350,000 Australian users aged 13 to 15.Some popular
        apps and websites, such as Roblox, Pinterest and WhatsApp, are exempt, but
        the list remains under review.Livestreaming service Twitch was added to the
        list less than two weeks ago.Meta said it was committed to complying with
        Australian law, but it called for app stores to be held accountable for age
        verification instead.\"The government should require app stores to verify
        age and obtain parental approval whenever teens under 16 download apps, eliminating
        the need for teens to verify their age multiple times across different apps,\"
        the Meta spokesperson said.\"Social media platforms could then use this verified
        age information to ensure teens are in age-appropriate experiences.\" Advertisement
        YouTube has also attacked the social media ban.The video-streaming giant said
        this week the new law would make young Australians \"less safe\" because those
        below 16 could still visit the website without an account, but would lose
        YouTube safety filters.But Australia''s Communications Minister Anika Wells
        described its argument as \"weird\".\"If YouTube is reminding us all that
        it is not safe and there''s content not appropriate for age-restricted users
        on their website, that''s a problem that YouTube needs to fix,\" said Wells.Wells
        added that some Australian teens had killed themselves as algorithms \"latched
        on\" - targeting them with content that drained their self-esteem.\"This specific
        law will not fix every harm occurring on the internet, but it will make it
        easier for kids to chase a better version of themselves,\" she said.The Sydney-based
        internet rights group Digital Freedom Project said it had challenged the laws
        in Australia''s High Court last week, calling them an \"unfair\" assault on
        freedom of speech.Platforms are expected to devise their own means to stop
        rebellious teenagers from trying to skirt the law, by using fake IDs, for
        instance, but \"no solution is likely to be 100 percent effective\", the internet
        safety watchdog has said.There is keen interest in whether Australia''s sweeping
