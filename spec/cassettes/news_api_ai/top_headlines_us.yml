        On 2 features multiple divisions, including one dedicated to providing lessons
        and a competition team. (Byron Garcia \/ Break On 2)\n\nWhen students enter
        Mudd Hall on Monday nights, the first thing they hear is bachata playing through
        the speakers. The second thing they hear is the squeaking of sneakers on the
        floor as Break On 2''s Club Annex rehearses.\n\nDelila Gonzalez, a senior
        studying theatre, leads Club Annex as its captain, teaching participants how
        to dance anything from salsa and bachata to cumbia.\n\nClub Annex is only
        one of three components of USC''s Break On 2: Latin Fusion, a dance team founded
        in 2004 that also has a performance team made up of 42 members, along with
        a smaller competition team.\n\nGonzalez said she was initially hesitant about
        auditioning for Break On 2. However, after she got onto the competition team,
        she quickly fell in love with it.\n\n\"I don''t think people understand how
        communal dance can be,\" Gonzalez said. \"It sounds so cheesy, but it genuinely
        brings people together.\"\n\nAfter Break On 2 renewed her passion for Latin
        Dance, Gonzalez began teaching Latin dance to high school students in collaboration
        with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps.\n\n\"[Latin dance] essentially consumed
        my whole life.\" Gonzalez said. \"I don''t only teach it [at USC]; I also
        teach it at a high school.\"\n\nVictoria Ocampos Costa, a senior studying
        business of cinematic arts and the president of Break On 2, originally did
        not make Break On 2''s performance team. But she was accepted after attending
        Club Annex for an entire year and auditioning the following fall. Ocampos
        Costa said being part of Break On 2 has been integral to her experience at
        USC.\n\n\"I love the team so much. It''s a huge part of who I am at USC, and
        it plays a big role in my journey here over the last four years.\" Ocampos
        Costa said. \"It creates a home for a lot of people, including myself. Break
        On 2 is not a Latino-exclusive club. We have members from all different nationalities
        and places, but it becomes a home because we spend so much time together.\"\n\nKaeley
        Cooper, a senior majoring in law, history and culture as well as social sciences,
        is the competition team captain at Break On 2. Cooper said she loves the energy
        of the group''s salsa nights, where even strangers feel connected to her through
        celebrating Latin dance.\n\n\"What I gained from it [is] not only a sense
        of community and the incredible people that I''ve met through the team but
        also getting to appreciate the culture and demonstrate and expose it to a
        variety of people,\" Cooper said.\n\nEvery first Friday of the month, Break
        On 2 hosts salsa nights with live music. According to graduate student Nathan
        Justin, the longest-tenured current Break On 2 member, these salsa nights
        have been an introduction to Latin dance for many students over the years.\n\nJustin
        has been in Break On 2 for six years, and it has been his home throughout
        his entire career at USC. For him, clubs like Break On 2 matter because they
        help connect people at such a large university.\n\n\"I think it provides an
        outlet for people to meet each other,\" Justin said. \"Partner dance is a
        fantastic way for people to work together to make a dance happen, and that
        kind of teamwork naturally makes a lot of good friends.\"\n\nBella Duarte,
        a junior studying psychology, is the co-creative director of Break On 2. Duarte
        co-choreographs all of the pieces the team presents throughout the fall, as
        well as the opener for their spring showcase. Duarte said the cultural aspect
        of the dance team speaks to her most both as a choreographer and community
        member.\n\n\"It''s important to have a group such as Break On 2 because there''s
        someone who can represent a minority on campus, represent something that''s
        just so bright,\" Duarte said. \"I think whenever we enter a room, there''s
        just so much color, so much vibrance.\"\n\nDuarte joined Break On 2 because
        she was in search of a community at USC that helped her connect with her culture.\n\n\"Break
        On 2 is probably the best community I have found here on campus, because I
        feel so at home,\" Duarte said. \"They make me feel so loved, and they''ve
        helped me embrace my Mexican side of my family.\"\n\nJustin emphasized Break
        On 2''s role in celebrating Latine culture. Being able to do different types
        of dances from across Latin America has been amazing while building a community
        at USC, Justin said.\n\n\"I think a lot of us say Break On 2 is a family,
        and it really is true,\" Justin said. \"It''s been my family throughout my
        entire time at USC, so we''re all united with a love for dance, but we don''t
        just dance -- we also look out for each other.\"", "source":{"uri":"dailytrojan.com",

        RocketNews", "body":"Australia''s world-first ban requires 10 major online
        platforms to block users aged 16.By AFP and APPublished On 4 Dec 20254 Dec
        2025Click here to share on social mediashare2ShareTech giant Meta has begun
        removing minors below 16 years of age in Australia from its platforms Instagram,
        Threads and Facebook ahead of the country''s world-first youth social media
        ban.\"While we are working hard to remove all users who we understand to be
        under the age of 16 by 10 December, compliance with the law will be an ongoing
        and multilayered process,\" a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday.Recommended
        Stories list of 3 itemsend of listAustralia requires 10 major online platforms,
        also including TikTok and YouTube, to block underage users by December 10,
        when the new law comes into force.Companies face fines of 49.5 million Australian
        dollars ($32m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to comply.Hundreds
        of thousands of adolescents are likely to be affected by the ban, with Instagram
        alone reporting about 350,000 Australian users aged 13 to 15.Some popular
        apps and websites, such as Roblox, Pinterest and WhatsApp, are exempt, but
        the list remains under review.Livestreaming service Twitch was added to the
        list less than two weeks ago.Meta said it was committed to complying with
        Australian law, but it called for app stores to be held accountable for age
        verification instead.\"The government should require app stores to verify
        age and obtain parental approval whenever teens under 16 download apps, eliminating
        the need for teens to verify their age multiple times across different apps,\"
        the Meta spokesperson said.\"Social media platforms could then use this verified
        age information to ensure teens are in age-appropriate experiences.\" Advertisement
        YouTube has also attacked the social media ban.The video-streaming giant said
        this week the new law would make young Australians \"less safe\" because those
        below 16 could still visit the website without an account, but would lose
        YouTube safety filters.But Australia''s Communications Minister Anika Wells
        described its argument as \"weird\".\"If YouTube is reminding us all that
        it is not safe and there''s content not appropriate for age-restricted users
        on their website, that''s a problem that YouTube needs to fix,\" said Wells.Wells
        added that some Australian teens had killed themselves as algorithms \"latched
        on\" - targeting them with content that drained their self-esteem.\"This specific
        law will not fix every harm occurring on the internet, but it will make it
        easier for kids to chase a better version of themselves,\" she said.The Sydney-based
        internet rights group Digital Freedom Project said it had challenged the laws
        in Australia''s High Court last week, calling them an \"unfair\" assault on
        freedom of speech.Platforms are expected to devise their own means to stop
        rebellious teenagers from trying to skirt the law, by using fake IDs, for
        instance, but \"no solution is likely to be 100 percent effective\", the internet
        safety watchdog has said.There is keen interest in whether Australia''s sweeping

        season", "body":"What 14 teams are positioned to make the NFL playoffs in
        the 2025 regular season, from the eight division winners to six total wild
        cards? What would the seeding look like in the race for Super Bowl 60?\n\nHere
        are the answers in Sporting News'' latest look at how the postseason field
        is coming together in both conferences going into the Sunday and Monday games
        of Week 15:\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: Packers, Steelers jump as Bears, Ravens drop;
        Chiefs, Colts slide again in Week 15\n\nThe Patriots are coming off a bye
        with a two-game lead over the Bills in the division race. They will host Buffalo
        on Sunday trying to clinch the East title with a three-game lead plus the
        head-to-head tiebreaker from a season sweep.\n\nThe Steelers are up a full
        game and head-to-head tiebreaker on the Ravens after beating that team in
        Week 14. They also are up three games on the third-place Bengals going into
        Monday night''s game vs. the Dolphins.\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers 9-4 (second
        place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers stayed ahead of the Bills with their overtime
        win over the Eagles in Week 14 as they still hold the conference-record tiebreaker
        for the top wild card (7-2 vs. 6-3). They are three games ahead of the third-place
        Chiefs, at whom they play on Sunday.\n\n6. Buffalo Bills 9-4 (second place,
        AFC East)\n\nThe Bills'' chances of winning a sixth consecutive division title
        come are fading and would be gone if they can''t win the Patriots. A win would
        put them down only one game with three to play.\n\n7. Houston Texans 8-5 (second
        place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans have rallied from 0-3 to go 8-2 since and
        stay a game behind the Jaguars in the division race. They are ahead of the
        third-place Colts for this third wild-card spot because of a division-record
        tiebreaker (4-1 vs. 2-2).\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (8-5)\n\n9. Baltimore Ravens
        (6-7)\n\n10. Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)\n\n11. Miami Dolphins (6-7)\n\n12. Cincinnati
        Bengals (4-9)\n\nThe Colts are the team to watch in the wild-card race but
        it will be tough with their schedule minus Daniel Jones. The Ravens or Bengals,
        who play each other on Sunday, will somehow need to pass the Steelers with
        the division being the only playoff path. The Chiefs and Dolphins have slim
        chances of earning wild cards.\n\n13. New York Jets (3-10)\n\n14. Cleveland
        Browns (3-10)\n\n15. Las Vegas Raiders (2-11)\n\n16. Tennessee Titans (2-11)\n\nAll
        four of these teams have been eliminated, with the Browns being the latest
        to join this club in Week 14.\n\nThe Rams lead the Packers by a half-game
        for this top spot that comes with home-field advantage and a first-round bye.
        They lead the division by a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Seahawks and
        a full game over the 49ers going into their game vs. the Lions.\n\n2. Green
        Bay Packers 9-3-1 (first place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers lead the division
        by a half-game and head-to-head tiebreaker over the Bears, who they beat in
        Week 14, and are up 1.5 games on of the third-place Lions, who they beat in
        Week 13. They are also one game ahead of the Eagles for this spot.\n\n3. Philadelphia
        Eagles 8-5 (first place, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles lead the division by 1.5
        games over the Cowboys after both teams lost in Week 14. They should end their
        three-game losing streak by beating the Raiders on Sunday.\n\n4. Carolina
        Panthers 7-6 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers lead the division by
        a half-game over the Buccaneers going into Sunday''s home game vs. the Saints
        after the Buccaneers opened Week 15 by losing at home to the Saints. The Panthers
        and Buccaneers still play twice, in Week 16 and Week 18.\n\n5. Seattle Seahawks
        10-3 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks kept pace with the Rams by routing
        the Falcons in Week 14. They remain a full game ahead of the third-place 49ers,
        who have a bye. The Seahawks are once again big favorites hosting the Colts.\n\n6.
        San Francisco 49ers 9-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers are coming off
        a bye to host the Titans on Sunday, trying to make up the one game on both
        the Seahawks and Rams to finish first in the division over the final four
        weeks.\n\n7. Chicago Bears 9-4 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears fell
        down here from No. 1 with their Week 14 loss to the Packers. They lead the
        third-place Lions by only one game for this spot. Chicago will hope to beat
        Cleveland on Sunday to either maintain or increase that advantage.\n\n8. Detroit
        Lions 8-5\n\n9. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 7-7\n\n10. Dallas Cowboys 6-6-1\n\n11.
        Minnesota Vikings 5-8\n\nThe Lions have the best wild-card shot here by far
        but need to beat the No. 1 Rams on the road to help their chances. The Bucs
        took a tough loss to open Week 15. The Cowboys and Vikings are on the brink
        of elimination.\n\n12. Atlanta Falcons 5-9\n\n13. Arizona Cardinals 3-10\n\n14.
        New Orleans Saints 3-10\n\n15. Washington Commanders 3-10\n\n16. New York
        Giants 2-11\n\nAll these teams were eliminated from playoff contention before
        Week 15.", "source":{"uri":"sportingnews.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Sporting

        "title":"Dealerships Can''t Seem to Sell These 2024 Car Models at All", "body":"Ever
        wonder which brand-new cars are gathering dust on dealer lots across America?
        iSeeCars did a deep dive into more than 2.6 million new car listings across
        the United States, revealing some surprising answers.\n\nThe data shows the
        percentage of 2024 inventory still sitting unsold, and the results paint an
        interesting picture of what today''s buyers are actually looking for. From
        luxury SUVs to sports cars, these twelve models are having a tougher time
        finding homes than dealers probably anticipated.\n\nSome of the names might
        surprise you, while others make perfect sense once you consider pricing, timing,
        and market trends.\n\nLeading the pack with a staggering 82% of inventory
        still available, the Dodge Hornet plug-in hybrid is struggling to find its
        audience. This compact crossover arrived with plenty of expectations, bringing
        electrification to the Dodge lineup in an unexpected package.\n\nThe pricing
        sits in an awkward middle ground where buyers shopping for practicality might
        opt for less expensive options, while performance enthusiasts may not see
        the Hornet as a true Dodge muscle vehicle. The plug-in hybrid powertrain adds
        complexity and cost that many shoppers in this segment simply aren''t asking
        for.\n\nIt''s a challenging market position when your brand identity is built
        on roaring V8s and quarter-mile times.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has long been
        a cornerstone of Jeep''s lineup, but more than 70% of 2024 models remain unsold
        at an average price above $64,000. That price point puts it in direct competition
        with luxury European SUVs that offer prestigious badges and refined experiences.\n\nThe
        midsize SUV market is fiercely competitive, especially at this price point
        where buyers have dozens of well-established two-row luxury and near-luxury
        options to choose from. Jeep''s recent quality perception issues haven''t
        helped matters, as buyers spending this much want assurance their investment
        will be reliable.\n\nThe Grand Cherokee remains capable and spacious, but
        convincing buyers to choose it over established luxury competitors at this
        price requires a compelling value proposition.\n\nAlfa Romeo''s entry into
        the compact luxury crossover segment has met a lukewarm reception, with nearly
        half of the 2024 Tonale Hybrid inventory still available. The Italian brand
        brings undeniable style and driving dynamics, but the hybrid powertrain in
        a segment where buyers often prioritize either pure efficiency or pure performance
        creates an identity challenge.\n\nAt almost $52,000, shoppers have access
        to well-established German competitors with stronger dealer networks and better
        resale values. The Tonale looks fantastic and drives with characteristic Alfa
        flair, but breaking into the American market with limited brand presence remains
        an uphill battle.\n\nEnthusiasts love what Alfa Romeo represents, though convincing
        mainstream luxury buyers to take the leap is another story entirely.\n\nThe
        Malibu''s struggles reflect a broader trend: the American sedan is facing
        an existential crisis. With 31% of inventory unsold, this dependable midsize
        sedan is caught in a market that has decisively shifted toward SUVs and crossovers.\n\nChevrolet
        has already announced the Malibu''s discontinuation, which certainly doesn''t
        help sales as buyers tend to avoid models they know are being phased out.
        The pricing is reasonable and the Malibu offers solid value with good fuel
        economy and a comfortable ride.\n\nHowever, when most buyers can get into
        a Chevy Trax or Trailblazer for similar money with the added versatility of
        a crossover, the traditional sedan becomes a tougher sell.\n\nThe non-hybrid
        Dodge Hornet appears again, this time the base model with 26% of inventory
        still on lots. At nearly $32,000, this Alfa Romeo Tonale-based crossover faces
        an identity crisis within the Dodge lineup.\n\nTraditional Dodge buyers expect
        American muscle and V8 rumble, not a turbocharged four-cylinder Italian-rooted
        crossover. The Hornet offers decent performance and modern features, but it
        doesn''t fit the brand''s muscle car image that draws customers to showrooms.
        Meanwhile, buyers simply looking for a compact crossover have dozens of more
        established options to choose from.\n\nDodge is attempting to pivot toward
        a more diverse lineup, though this transition is proving challenging when
        your brand loyalty is built on a very specific type of vehicle.\n\nWhen your
        average transaction price approaches six figures, you''re competing with some
        serious luxury iron. The Grand Wagoneer L stretches the already-large Grand
        Wagoneer even further, creating a true land yacht for families who need maximum
        space.\n\nAt over $92,000, buyers at this level expect Range Rover levels
        of refinement and prestige, which represents a significant leap for the Jeep
        brand. The Grand Wagoneer L offers impressive capability and generous three-row
        seating, but the price tag puts it in rarefied air where badge perception
        matters enormously.\n\nJeep has made tremendous strides in luxury execution,
        yet convincing ultra-luxury buyers to choose a Jeep over established European
        competitors remains a formidable challenge.\n\nGenesis continues working to
        establish itself in the American luxury market, and the electric GV60 crossover
        exemplifies both the brand''s potential and its challenges. With nearly 22%
        of inventory unsold, this stylish EV offers distinctive design and impressive
        technology at a price point below comparable European EVs.\n\nThe challenge
        is brand awareness and dealer network size, as Genesis simply doesn''t have
        the visibility or accessibility of established luxury brands. The GV60 delivers
        genuine luxury and engaging driving dynamics in an eye-catching package.\n\nHowever,
        when spending nearly $58,000 on an electric vehicle, many buyers gravitate
        toward Tesla''s established Supercharger network or prestigious German alternatives
        with decades of luxury credibility.\n\nThe legendary Charger''s presence on
        this list might seem surprising given its cult following, but at nearly $60,000
        average price, we''re looking at well-equipped or performance variants. The
        Charger has enjoyed an incredible run as one of the last V8-powered sedan
        options, yet the transition to electric power looms on the horizon.\n\nBuyers
        interested in the traditional Charger experience may be waiting for deals
        as inventory clears, while those interested in the upcoming electric version
        are simply waiting for its arrival. The pricing also reflects how expensive
        these muscle sedans have become, potentially pricing out some traditional
        buyers.\n\nThe Charger remains an automotive icon, though this transitional
        moment creates uncertainty in the marketplace.\n\nThe reborn Z sports car
        brought tremendous excitement when it launched, combining retro-inspired styling
        with modern performance. However, with nearly 19% of inventory unsold at an
        average price above $53,000, the market reality for two-seater sports cars
        is challenging.\n\nThis price point puts the Z in competition with the Toyota
        Supra, Chevrolet Corvette, and various European sports cars that offer different
        flavors of performance. The Z delivers fantastic driving dynamics and that
        classic long-hood proportions that enthusiasts love, but sports car sales
        volumes are inherently limited.\n\nAdditionally, the automatic-only NISMO
        trim disappointed some purists, even though manual transmissions remain available
        on other Z trims.\n\nThe Wrangler 4xe brings electrification to Jeep''s most
        iconic nameplate, yet 18% of inventory remains unsold at an eye-watering average
        of nearly $61,000. This price reflects the technology premium for the plug-in
        hybrid system, pushing the Wrangler into luxury vehicle territory.\n\nTraditional
        Wrangler buyers often prioritize simplicity and proven off-road capability,
        while the added complexity of a PHEV system may not align with how they use
        their vehicles. The 4xe actually offers impressive off-road benefits with
        instant electric torque and silent running capability, plus daily driving
        efficiency that traditional Wranglers can''t match.\n\nHowever, convincing
        buyers to spend this much on a Wrangler requires demonstrating clear advantages
        over the less expensive conventional powertrains.\n\nHyundai''s electrified
        Tucson represents a logical evolution of the popular compact crossover, though
        14% of PHEV inventory remains available. At over $45,000, the plug-in hybrid
        commands a significant premium over the regular Tucson, which already offers
        excellent value and features.\n\nBuyers interested in electrification at this
        price point have numerous options, including fully electric vehicles that
        eliminate gas stations entirely. The Tucson PHEV makes sense for drivers who
        want electric-only commuting capability with gas backup for longer trips,
        though that specific use case represents a smaller slice of the market.\n\nHyundai''s
        rapid advancement in quality and technology is impressive, yet the price premium
        for plug-in capability remains a hurdle for value-conscious crossover shoppers.\n\nThe
        standard-length Grand Wagoneer rounds out our list with 13% of inventory unsold
        at an average price approaching $84,000. Jeep''s flagship SUV aims to reclaim
        the brand''s heritage of premium American utility vehicles with genuine luxury
        appointments.\n\nThe execution is impressive with high-quality materials,
        advanced technology, and commanding road presence that makes a statement.
        Yet at this price, buyers comparison shop against well-established luxury
        SUVs from brands with long histories of premium vehicle production.\n\nThe
        Grand Wagoneer succeeds in offering Jeep capability with upscale execution,
        though breaking into the established luxury SUV market requires time for brand
        perception to catch up with product reality.\n\nThis inventory analysis reveals
        some clear patterns about today''s automotive market. Plug-in hybrids face
        an uphill battle as buyers increasingly choose either conventional powertrains
        or fully electric vehicles, skipping the middle ground entirely.\n\nPremium
        pricing pushes vehicles into competitive territory where brand perception
        and established luxury credentials matter enormously. The data also shows
        that even beloved nameplates like the Wrangler and Charger face sales challenges
        when configurations push prices into unexpected territory.\n\nThese inventory
        levels don''t necessarily indicate bad vehicles, but rather misalignments
        between product offerings, pricing, and what buyers are actually seeking in
        today''s market.", "source":{"uri":"autos.yahoo.com", "dataType":"news", "title":"Yahoo

        News-Tribune", "body":"BALTIMORE -- Blake Horvath to Eli Heidenreich.\n\nThat''s
        the connection that led Navy to such a memorable season -- and the two of
        them came through again on the biggest play of the biggest game.\n\nHorvath
        threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Heidenreich with 6:32 remaining -- on fourth-and-goal
        -- and No. 22 Navy rallied to beat Army 17-16 on Saturday. Heidenreich, the
        career and single-season leader in yards receiving for the Midshipmen, caught
        six of Horvath''s seven completions on the day.\n\n\"Who wouldn''t go to him?\"
        Horvath said. \"Talk about an all-time Navy legend. You''re going to be talking
        about Eli Heidenreich for years and years and years.\"\n\nAlthough it was
        clearly a passing situation, and Heidenreich was Navy''s top target, he was
        single covered over the middle.\n\n\"Tried to bring some pressure on them,\"
        Army coach Jeff Monken said. \"Good throw and good catch.\"\n\nWith President
        Donald Trump in attendance, Navy (10-2) got its second straight victory over
        Army (6-6), and the Midshipmen won the Commander-In-Chief''s Trophy for a
        second straight season. The Black Knights have not beaten a Navy team that
        was ranked by the AP since 1955.\n\nHorvath was fortunate to have the chance
        to throw that decisive touchdown pass. On second-and-goal from the 1, he lost
        the ball while attempting a tush push. Army linebacker Eric Ford had a chance
        to scoop it up, but Navy running back Alex Tecza lunged over to prevent that,
        and Heidenreich eventually fell on the ball back at the 8.\n\n\"That''s probably
        the last thing you want to see on the 1-yard line is you turn around and the
        ball is just bouncing behind you,\" Heidenreich said. \"I was blocking down.
        I thought he had pushed in, and kind of out of my peripheral I saw it going
        behind me.\"\n\nOn the next play, Horvath was nearly sacked, but he was able
        to throw the ball toward Tecza as he went down. The ball fell incomplete instead
        of being caught around the 15, which was just as well for Navy because it
        made going for it on fourth down a more viable option.\n\n\"I kind of felt
        like we had to,\" Navy coach Brian Newberry said. \"The nature of what they
        do offensively, despite how well we played in the second half, you may not
        get the ball back.\"\n\nEven after Heidenreich''s touchdown and an Army punt,
        Navy still had to escape one more near-turnover. On third-and-3 from the Army
        43, the ball popped loose on a run by Horvath, but he was able to catch it
        out of the air. It came loose again and the Black Knights recovered, but after
        a review, Horvath was ruled down before the second fumble -- a yard short
        of the line to gain.\n\nTecza then ran for the first down that enabled Navy
        to kneel out the clock, and Horvath appeared to wave goodbye at the Army sideline.
        There was a bit of a ruckus near midfield after the final kneel-down before
        things eventually calmed down for the traditional singing of the alma maters.\n\n\"They
        want to talk all their crap during the game and act like they''re so tough,\"
        Horvath said. \"The excuse last year was that they played a conference championship
        game before us. This year, we''ll see what it is.\"\n\nThe Black Knights were
        trying to turn the tables on Navy after a ranked Army team -- which had just
        won the American Conference title -- lost to the Midshipmen last year.\n\nThe
        teams traded touchdown drives to start the game, each lasting 13 plays, 75
        yards and more than seven minutes. Horvath had a 5-yard scoring run, and Army
        quarterback Cale Hellums answered with a 2-yarder. Army''s first drive didn''t
        end until 5 seconds into the second quarter.\n\nThen it was a while before
        anyone reached the end zone again. With Army up 10-7 late in the second quarter,
        the ball slipped out of Horvath''s hand while he was looking to pass. Army
        recovered the fumble at its own 45 with 20 seconds to play and moved into
        range for a 45-yard field goal by Dawson Jones.\n\nNavy''s defense stiffened
        in the second half, but the Midshipmen still flirted with disaster. Horvath
        threw an interception in the third quarter that was initially returned to
        the end zone -- before a replay showed Army''s Justin Weaver had a knee down
        when he picked off the pass at the Navy 32. The Black Knights had to settle
        for three -- Dawson connected on a career-long 48-yard kick.\n\nNavy''s wing-T
        offense has been explosive this season. The Midshipmen entered the day with
        an FBS-high 10 plays of at least 60 yards. Army mostly kept them contained,
        but Horvath slipped free for a 37-yard run that set up a third-quarter field
        goal that made it 16-10.\n\nAfter Hellums'' underthrown pass was intercepted
        by Phillip Hamilton, giving Navy the ball at the 50 with 11:19 to play, Tecza''s
        24-yard run made it first-and-goal from the 5.\n\nTrump tossed the coin before
        the game at midfield, then returned at halftime to walk from the Navy sideline
        to the Army one.\n\nArmy defensive lineman Jack Bousum, who is from Annapolis,
        had a big game against his hometown team. He finished with 1\u00bd sacks and
        a fumble recovery.\n\nThe Black Knights were the better team in the first
        half Saturday but didn''t do much offensively after that.\n\n\"They beat blocks,\"
        Monken said. \"We didn''t sustain the blocks we needed to.\"\n\nHorvath made
        some big plays and some bad ones, and the Navy defense was stout in the second
        half. The Midshipmen finished tied for first in the AAC this year but missed
        out on the league title game because of tiebreakers. This victory matters
        more to them anyway.\n\nArmy faces UConn in the Fenway Bowl on Dec. 27, while

        travel dates yet", "body":"Britain''s roads are set to see the busiest festive
        period on record as millions embark on their Christmas commute this year.\n\nExperts
        from the AA and RAC have predicted an unprecedented build-up on major routes,
        with commuters joining the last-minute surge of shoppers and motorists setting
        out on festive breaks.\n\nThe AA reported that traffic will peak on Friday
        (December 19), with about 24.4 million cars on the UK''s roads.\n\nDrivers
        have been warned to expect long delays while roads are expected to remain
        busy into the start of next week.\n\nThe RAC has estimated 37.5 million leisure
        trips on roads across the country between Wednesday (December 17) and Christmas
        Eve (December 24).\n\nThis is the highest week-before-Christmas count since
        data tracking started in 2013.\n\nTransport analytics company, Inrix, predicted
        long hold-ups for several major routes on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, weekend gridlocks
        have also been forecast from 11am to 7pm on both Saturday (December 20) and
        Christmas Eve.\n\nAlthough a slight drop in traffic to 22.7 million is predicted
        on Christmas Eve, the RAC''s expert calculated 4.2 million leisure trips on
        the day alone, with an estimated 18.3 million cars on the road on Christmas
        Day (December 25).\n\nDecember 24 is forecast to be the most significant day
        for road trips over the festive season.\n\nAA expert patrol, Shaun Jones,
        said: \"It''s beginning to look a lot like traffic.\n\n\"Our advice is simple:
        plan ahead, check your route and allow extra time.\n\nAccording to the AA''s
        member survey and the RAC''s national survey, between 25% and 30% of respondents
        planning to drive in the week leading to Christmas intend to do so for work.\n\nMost
        participants also revealed that they would not typically travel more than
        50 miles.\n\nAdding to the expected congestion, the M27 motorway will be closed
        from 8pm on Christmas Eve until 4am on January 4 for necessary works.\n\nThis
        closure will disrupt both directions between Junctions 9 and 11, affecting
        journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth.\n\nThe RAC''s mobile servicing
        and repairs team leader, Nick Mullender, commented: \"With record numbers
        predicted to be taking to the roads this Christmas, journeys have the potential
        to be Grinch-worthy without some careful planning.\"\n\nNational Highways
        has confirmed that they will endeavour to \"remove as many roadworks as we
        safely can\" to help alleviate traffic disruptions over the holiday period.\n\nThe
        AA''s forecast was based on a member survey of more than 10,000, and the RAC''s
        estimates came from a national survey of 2,191 UK adults.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nThe
        responses were applied to the 34 million registered cars in the UK.\n\nWith
        the promise of standstill traffic on the horizon, motorists have been advised
        to check their routes and plan accordingly.\n\nWhat days are you planning

        "title":"''Fire Steve Kerr'' Trends as Warriors Waste Another Steph Curry
        Masterpiece", "body":"Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors shoots
        over Jerami Grant #9 of the Portland Trail Blazers during the second half
        at Moda Center on December 14, 2025 in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe Golden State
        Warriors wasted another Steph Curry masterpiece on Sunday night, as they suffered
        a 136-131 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. After the game, the \"Fire Steve
        Kerr\" phrase began trending on X and other social media platforms, with Warriors
        fans urging ownership to fire the longtime head coach.\n\nCurry dropped 48
        points, including 12 threes, but his heroic efforts went in vain, primarily
        because of Golden State''s lackluster defense that allowed the Trail Blazers
        to amass 24 second-chance points, 18 fast-break points and 48 points in the
        paint.\n\nIt was the second consecutive game when the Warriors wasted a terrific
        performance from Curry, who scored 38 points in a losing effort to an Anthony
        Edwards-less Minnesota Timberwolves less than 48 hours before.\n\nWarriors
        fans'' frustration with Kerr boils down to his substitution patterns, defensive
        schemes and erratic usage of some players, specifically the younger players.
        While Jonathan Kuminga was hit with a healthy DNP for a third consecutive
        game, Will Richard -- one of Golden State''s bright spots earlier in the season
        -- warmed the bench for a second successive game despite being one of their
        best long-range shooters.\n\nOne fan was particularly frustrated with Kerr''s
        insistence on going small in closing lineups, even as the Timberwolves punished
        them on the inside by grabbing several key offensive boards in the final few
        minutes of the game.\n\n\"Fire Steve [expletive] Kerr,\" fumed one fan. \"This
        is [expletive] unacceptable. No matter how trash, he keeps including Podz
        into a tiny lineup that NEVER WORKS to close a game for the last 3 [expletive]
        years.\"\n\n\"There are so much problems with this team and has been for many
        years,\" wrote another fan. \"Steve Kerr has to be gone after this season.
        This roster once again is a mess and won''t be fixed at the deadline.\"\n\n\"Will
        Richard getting DNPs. Steve Kerr needs to be fired,\" wrote another fan on
        X in a post receiving nearly 2K likes within a few hours.\n\nAnother longtime
        Warriors fan fumed at Kerr''s insistence to close with a small-ball lineup
        of Steph Curry, Brandin Podziemski, De''Anthony Melton, Jimmy Butler III and
        Draymond Green.\n\n\"Steve Kerr must be FIRED,\" he wrote. \"This piece of
        [expletive] sat all of his bigs and closed with Draymond at C with no defense
        Butler at PF to include PODS in a tiny lineup. This [expletive] keeps throwing
        games, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!\"\n\nKerr''s contract expires at the end of the
        2025-26 season. However, most insiders covering the Warriors expect the team
        to extend him for at least one more season to align his timeline with the
        contracts of Curry, Butler and Green, all of whom can become free agents after
        the 2026-27 season. Ahead of the 2025-26 season, Kerr made it clear that he
        was comfortable regardless of his uncertain future in Golden State.\n\n\"However
        this ends it''s going to be done in a really quality way,\" Kerr said.\n\n\"It''s
        going to happen the right way. If it''s meant for me to keep going, I''m going
        to keep going. If it''s meant to be for the team to move on to someone else,
        there will be nothing but gratitude and appreciation. This makes it easy for
        everybody. Let''s see where we are at the end of the year.\"\n\nKerr installed
        a new offense in Golden State when he took over in 2014-15, which helped Steph
        Curry become the MVP. While his last few years have been met with a lot of
        criticism, he''ll still go down as one of the greatest coaches in NBA history.",

        "title":"Seahawks outlast Philip Rivers and Colts 18-16 on Jason Myers'' 56-yard
        field goal", "body":"SEATTLE (AP) -- Jason Myers has quietly been a big part
        of the Seattle Seahawks'' success this season.\n\nHe was the only reason they
        won Sunday.\n\nMyers kicked a franchise-record six field goals, including
        a 56-yarder with 29 seconds left, and the Seahawks outlasted 44-year-old quarterback
        Philip Rivers and the Indianapolis Colts 18-16 without scoring a touchdown.\n\n\"I
        hit it well,\" Myers said. \"A little slice there, but once I got it up, I
        knew (I) hit a really strong ball.\"\n\nMyers has converted 24 of his last
        25 field goals, with the only miss a 61-yard try on Nov. 16, and he leads
        the NFL with a career-best 154 points.\n\nHe also converted from 47, 52, 46,
        32 and 30 yards, and the Seahawks (11-3) needed every one of them to beat
        Rivers, who hadn''t thrown a pass in an NFL game in nearly five years. Seattle
        extended its winning streak to four games.\n\nIndy trailed for just 1:58 and
        went ahead 13-3 on Rivers'' first touchdown pass since the Colts'' 27-24 loss
        to the Buffalo Bills in the playoffs on Jan. 9, 2021. He connected with Josh
        Downs on third down for an 8-yard score.\n\n\"It was exciting,\" Rivers said.
        \"Shoot, it was exciting to take a 13-3 lead. But first off, our play that
        we kind of had all week in the red zone in that area on that down and distance
        on that hash, we practiced in the exact same spot this week. So, when things
        go like that, they fire you up. Obviously, you throw in the fact that it''s
        been 1,800 days since throwing a touchdown or interception for that matter.
        So, yeah, both of those boxes were checked.\"\n\nDesperate to salvage their
        season after Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending torn Achilles tendon, the
        Colts (8-6) turned to Rivers, a grandfather who''d been coaching high school
        football and was a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nRivers
        also led the Colts into position for Blake Grupe''s go-ahead, 60-yard field
        goal with 47 seconds left. He finished 18 of 27 for 120 yards with the touchdown
        and an interception, with the pick coming on his final pass as he tried to
        force the ball down the field in the closing seconds. Coby Bryant made the
        interception, his career-high fourth this season.\n\n\"He actually played
        pretty well,\" Bryant said. \"They got the ball out fast, we knew that, on
        screens, and we knew about the run game as well, too. So, we had to respect
        everything and just play our ball.\"\n\nIndianapolis has lost four straight
        and five of six to fall out of playoff position in the AFC.\n\nThe Seahawks,
        who had won their previous two games by a combined score of 63-9, grinded
        this one out.\n\nRashid Shaheed returned Grupe''s kickoff 28 yards to the
        Seattle 37, and Sam Darnold connected with Shaheed twice for 25 yards to set
        up Myers. The game-winning drive was Darnold''s third this season and 13th
        of his career.\n\nDarnold finished 22 of 36 for 271 yards in Seattle''s first
        victory without a touchdown since Dec. 26, 2024, when the Seahawks beat Chicago
        6-3.\n\nSeattle remained tied with the Los Angeles Rams atop the NFC West,
        and the rivals meet Thursday night for the division lead.\n\n\"It gives us
        a lot of momentum,\" offensive lineman Grey Zabel said. \"It''s obviously
        a lot easier to celebrate a tough win than it is to try to come into the locker
        room and pick our spirits up after a loss. I''m glad we have Jason Myers on
        our squad.\"\n\nSmith-Njigba bounces back\n\nNFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba,
        who was held below 100 yards in each of the last two weeks, had seven catches
        for 113 yards, including a 39-yard catch to set up Myers'' fifth field goal,
        which put the Seahawks ahead 15-13.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Smith-Njigba said.
        \"Taking care of my body and making sure I''m here for my teammates, that''s
        what I want to do. Honestly, I could care less about any stat right now. I
        just want to win.\"\n\nNot Taylor''s era\n\nNFL rushing leader Jonathan Taylor
        had 25 carries for 87 yards, his most since he had 244 on Nov. 9 against Atlanta,
        when Indy was still riding high. The Seahawks were happy to hold him to 3.5
        yards per carry.\n\n\"That was big,\" linebacker Ernest Jones IV said. \"We
        knew coming in they were going to try to lean on his arm, the whole game.
        We knew they were going to try to use him a bunch. So, we knew coming in to
        just make sure we stop him. If anything, all 11 heads to the ball, and let''s
        hit him hard.\"\n\nShaheed surging\n\nShaheed had just four catches for 34
        yards in his first four games with the Seahawks after they acquired him from
        New Orleans. Over the last two games, he has combined for 12 catches and 141
        yards -- including seven receptions for 74 yards Sunday.\n\n\"He came in clutch,
        that''s what we expect for him to get open, and he does that,\" Smith-Njigba
        said. \"He runs great routes and he''s somebody we rely on and we can depend
        on him, so it''s awesome.\"\n\nInjuries\n\nColts: Offensive lineman Bernhard
        Raimann injured an elbow in the second quarter and did not return.\n\nSeahawks:
        LB Derick Hall injured his hand in the first quarter and returned in the second
        quarter. T Abe Lucas injured his right arm\/shoulder in the second half but
        returned.\n\nUp next\n\nColts: Host San Francisco on Monday, Dec. 22.\n\nSeahawks:
        Host the Rams on Thursday night.\n\nAP NFL: https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/nfl",

        Reece Merrick has revealed the company''s strategy behind the Ripple USD (RLUSD)
        stablecoin.\n\nExecutive Reece Merrick claims that RLUSD is moving beyond
        being a \"Ripple-only\" asset and positions it as the universal infrastructure
        for the entire crypto market.\n\nThis comes after the company rolled out RLUSD
        to multiple Ethereum Layer-2 chains, including Optimism, Base, Ink\/Inkchain,
        and Unichain, with the help of Wormhole''s Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard.\n\nRLUSD
        aims to become the \"definitive and trusted gateway,\" meaning that it will
        be a regulated banking tool for the blockchain.\n\nInstead of fighting for
        users to come to them, Ripple is taking their product to where the users already
        are. They emphasize that the future is \"multi-chain.\" Ripple cannot expect
        all users to migrate to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to use their products.\n\nBy
        expanding to Layer 2s (Optimism, Base, Ink, Unichain), Merrick is saying RLUSD
        must be \"chain-agnostic.\" It needs to function just as well on Ethereum-based
        networks as it does on the XRPL.\n\nMerrick has stressed that \"RLUSD\" needs
        to exist wherever there is demand.\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) activity
        is currently surging on Layer 2 networks (like Base). If RLUSD were confined
        only to XRPL and Ethereum Mainnet, it would miss out on this massive volume.",

        "title":"Shameless Jake Tapper Turns Trump Health Crisis Into Book Plug",
        "body":"The CNN host has been called out for how he covers Trump compared
        to Biden.\n\nCNN host Jake Tapper has defended himself against claims he is
        not covering Donald Trump''s health decline in the same way he documented
        Joe Biden''s cognitive stumbles.\n\nTapper appeared on the latest episode
        of Pod Save America, plugging his new book, Race Against Terror, which covers
        the story of an al Qaeda terrorist.\n\nThe book, co-written with Axios'' National
        Political Correspondent, Alex Thompson, claimed that the Biden administration
        denied \"the existence of health issues the nation had been watching for years\"
        which resulted in the presidential debate of June 2024. Tapper moderated the
        event on CNN at the time.\n\nThat debate exposed Biden''s deteriorating mental
        capacity and led to him stepping down at the age of 81, making way for Democratic
        candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Alex and I wrote a book about an unprecedented
        event happening, which was Joe Biden having such a horrible performance at
        a presidential debate where his only job was to convince people he was up
        to the task of being president for another four years,\" Tapper claimed.\n\n\"The
        question wasn''t even about the performance of the debate, although it was
        unprecedentedly horrible. It was that he wasn''t able to go out any time in
        the following weeks and make any Democrats feel or sufficient numbers of Democrats
        feel better that he could do this job. And frankly, I understand that there
        are a lot of people out there who think I would take President Biden in a
        coma over Donald Trump. I understand.\n\n\"I don''t know anybody who thinks
        that he could be president right now and all the way through 2029 in his current
        state,\" Tapper added of Biden.\n\nVietor said he had noticed that when Trump
        has been captured nodding off in the White House or makes a slip up that suggests
        a possible cognitive decline that angry social media users have tagged Tapper,
        claiming he is actively ignoring reporting on the 79-year-old''s health.\n\nInstead,
        Tapper, with copies of his latest book intentionally propped up in the background
        as he and Vietor spoke, insisted he had learned from mistakes in covering
        Biden''s failing health when reporting on Trump''s issues.\n\n\"I mean, we
        cover it all the time on my show,\" Tapper said of covering Trump''s health
        on his CNN show The Lead. \"All the time. And I think that is to a large degree
        because we saw what happened with Biden and while we covered it, we didn''t
        cover it... maybe we didn''t ask as many questions as we should have at the
        time.\"\n\nTapper continued, \"I think it is a legitimate question for any
        president of any age, but particularly anybody who is like in the range of
        being an octogenarian, right?\"\n\nThe CNN host cited covering Trump''s December
        9 Truth Social post where he lashed out at the New York Times for covering
        of his health issues and reduced workload.\n\n\"I will know when I am ''slowing
        up,'' but it''s not now!,\" Trump posted. \"After all of the work I have done
        with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe
        it''s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others,
        to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean ''THE PRESIDENT
        OF THE UNITED STATES''.\"\n\n\"I literally cover it all the time,\" Tapper
        said. \"I covered that crazy Truth Social rant when he was mad at The New
        York Times for covering his aging and he called it sedition or treasonous.\"\n\nHe
        continued, \"I covered it on social media and I also covered it on my show,
        right? Like, I do, I cover it.\"\n\nTapper, in common with CNN and other outlets
        including the New York Times, barely reported on Trump''s clear health issues
        for months. The Daily Beast has forensically reported on the 79-year-old''s
        swollen cankles, frequent napping and incoherent speech for months.\n\nThe
        Daily Beast has contacted CNN and Tapper''s publisher for comment.", "source":{"uri":"thedailybeast.com",

        bugs, tar and anything else from your vehicle. Works great, even on the grill
        and chrome work. Leaves no residue or odor and won''t harm the paint. I just
        make a paste with baking soda and water, clean away and just rinse off. Works
        better than any commercial product I''ve tried. This method even cleans away
        the cloudy film on headlight covers. -- Bud\n\nCUSTOM FLOOR MATS\n\nI wanted
        floor mats for our minivan, so I stopped by our local car dealership. Boy,
        was I floored (pardon the pun). I checked a discount department store and,
        while their mats were priced more reasonably, they didn''t fit well. I found
        a perfect solution by buying clear plastic runner material that is available
        by the yard at the home improvement center. With a utility knife, I customized
        the fit around the seat hardware. This saved a lot of money and works beautifully.

        worst refrigerator odors. I store kimchee (Korean pickled cabbage with a distinct
        odor) in my refrigerator regularly, and I don''t smell it anymore! Simply
        take out the used coffee filter with the coffee grinds in it and place it
        in your refrigerator in an open container. It works better than baking soda
        or any other commercial remedy. I''ve tried them all. Just replace the coffee
        grinds when they dry up. -- Jay\n\nCURB HUNGER FIRST\n\nI am a grocery store
        checker, and trust me when I say never do your shopping when you are hungry!
        I can easily pick the hungry shoppers from the rest. Not only do they buy
        more stuff when they arrive hungry, their carts are full of junk food. If
        you can''t eat before you get to the store, grab a roll or cookie from the
        bakery before you start your shopping. -- Candi\n\nHIDE THE SCRATCH\n\nHere''s
        a great way to hide scratches on wood furniture. First, soak the scratch with
        a bit of water to open the wood. Select a crayon that is as close to the right
        color as possible. Apply the waxy substance to the scratch; rub it in well
        with a soft cloth and then buff. -- Jo-Ann\n\nCAMPUS HEALTH CARE\n\nPart of
        most college student fees goes toward student health services. The service
        can include unlimited visits with doctors, nurse practitioners and nurses,
        routine lab work, x-rays, pharmacy, health education, orthopedics, HIV and
        STD testing. Low-cost services include travel immunizations, flu shots, discounted

        out their campus student health services. -- Kathleen\n\nSECRET SPICES\n\nI
        keep a bag of frozen chopped spinach in the freezer. I add a handful to spaghetti
        sauce, ground beef, pizza sauce, fettuccine etc. I tell my kids it''s spices.
        They eat it up as long as I''m careful not to overdo it. They actually miss

        "title":"The illuminating story of Mr. Trump goes to the store", "body":"CCTV
        captured this (completely fake) conversation between President Donald Trump
        and a grocery store clerk yesterday.\n\nCLERK: That''ll be $286.47, Mr. President.\n\nTRUMP:
        Did you swipe my customer rewards card? I thought the Twinkies were half off.\n\nCLERK:
        Yes, I did, but we''re doing this new thing where you have to download our
        app, log in, create a profile, find the item, scan the bar code and select
        \"clip coupon\" to get the discount.\n\nTRUMP: I''m not certain that was worth
        the investment.\n\nCLERK: Yeah, the laundry detergent was buy 15, get one
        free, but none of the rest of the stuff was on sale.\n\nTRUMP: This is ridiculous.
        Haven''t you people heard how great the stock market is doing? The S&P is
        on a rocket ride! The Dow Jones had a record-high close.\n\nCLERK: Most middle-class
        Americans only have about 10% to 20% of their net worth invested in the stock
        market, and lower-income folks come in at about 1%, if they''re even in the
        stock market at all. Less than a third of them are, you know. Stock market
        performance isn''t something that moves the needle with most regular people.\n\nTRUMP:
        Don''t give me that malarkey. I just made the Fed cut interest rates. Why
        don''t poor people issue bonds at lower rates, allowing them to spend less
        money on servicing their debts?\n\nCLERK: Sir, this is a Schwegmann''s.\n\nTRUMP:
        The unemployment rate is 4.4%, for Pete Hegseth''s sake. Everyone who wants
        a job can get one.\n\nCLERK: That''s partially true. To clarify, fewer people
        are getting laid off; however, hiring is also stagnant. Almost 40% of Americans
        are gig workers or freelancers and have little to no benefits, guaranteed
        paid time off or job security. And anyway, the federal minimum wage has been
        $7.25 since 2009, which comes out to $15,080 a year if you''re working 40
        hours a week.\n\nTRUMP: That''s my Diet Coke budget for the month.\n\nCLERK:
        Right. And the minimum wage is even lower if you''re a tipped worker, younger
        than 20 or have a disability. Housing is a mess, with median home prices in
        the $400,000 range and rates over 6%.\n\nAvailability is low because no one
        wants to sell when they can''t afford to buy another house, and rents are
        -- if you''ll pardon the pun -- through the roof. The real catastrophe is
        the cost of living, which is what you''re noticing right now. Groceries are
        expensive, right?\n\nTRUMP: They are not. After I (allegedly) pressured them,
        Walmart agreed to lower the cost of its Thanksgiving meals.\n\nCLERK: But
        there was less stuff in the meal. It''s like what we''re doing with pre-packaged
        items at the grocery store, where manufacturers are decreasing the amount
        of product in the packaging and charging the same amount. It''s a tactic to
        obscure price increases.\n\nTRUMP: Wrong! Everything is better now that we''re
        on the other side of the Biden sandwich.\n\nCLERK: Speaking of sandwiches,
        even though wheat itself is cheaper, bread is at a historically high price
        and continues to increase. Isn''t that odd? Meat, fish, eggs and poultry are
        up 5.2% since only September. And don''t even get me started on health care.\n\nTRUMP:
        Well, I have just strongly hinted that I''m going to change the drug classification
        of marijuana, so at least you''ll be able to smoke a joint in public.\n\nCLERK:
        You really think it''s a good idea to give people the munchies right about
        now?\n\nTRUMP: I''ve had enough of this. What''s the total again?\n\nCLERK:
        It''s $286.27.\n\nTRUMP: Go ahead and take it out of my Bitcoin account. The
        Saudi prince set one up for me, special when I tore into that nasty lady who
        had the gall to ask about him having a journalist murdered.\n\nCLERK: We don''t
        accept cryptocurrency, which is volatile and unregulated, and mostly helpful
        for money launderers, human traffickers and other criminals. And here are
        your Trump commemorative coins back. We don''t take those, either.\n\nTRUMP:
        You don''t happen to work for ABC News, do you?\n\nCLERK: No, sir. I''m an
        economist. I used to work at the Department of Labor -- before you fired me.\n\nGeorgia
