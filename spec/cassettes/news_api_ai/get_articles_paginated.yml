        "title":"Assam: Shutdown by Tezpur varsity students enters 6th day, CM''s
        proposal for pro VC rejected", "body":"Guwahati, Dec 4 (PTI) The shutdown
        by students of Tezpur University in Assam entered its sixth day on Thursday
        over their demand for the removal of the vice-chancellor, while staffers of
        the varsity rejected Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma''s proposal for the
        appointment of a pro VC.\n\nState Congress president Gaurav Gogoi has also
        accused Sarma of \"masking the failures\" of current VC Shambhu Nath Singh
        by suggesting the appointment of a pro vice chancellor.\n\nThe students of
        the varsity have been protesting since mid-September for alleged corruption
        and financial irregularities, and have started the shutdown of all academic
        activities on the campus from November 29 for an indefinite period.\n\nA faculty
        member said the shutdown has been relaxed for departmental emergencies and
        pending work for a few hours in the morning for three days since Wednesday.\n\nSarma
        on Wednesday said he had spoken to Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan
        regarding the shutdown of Tezpur University and urged him to appoint a pro
        VC immediately, pending an impartial enquiry into the conduct of the present
        VC.\n\n\"The Tezpur University fraternity strongly rebuts the Assam chief
        minister''s recent statement regarding the ongoing crisis on the campus. His
        suggestion to appoint a pro vice chancellor reflects a clear misunderstanding
        of the movement''s long-standing and repeatedly communicated demand: the urgent
        appointment of an acting vice chancellor,\" Tezpur University United Forum
        (TUUF) said in a statement late on Wednesday.\n\nThe ongoing agitation in
        the central varsity in Sonitpur district is being carried out under the aegis
        of the TUUF.\n\nThe forum also claimed that the university has been in \"turmoil\"
        for 76 days, and during the entire period, the chief minister \"chose to remain
        silent\".\n\n\"His sudden involvement - only after the situation gained national
        attention - raises serious concern about whether he is acting out of genuine
        responsibility or political self-preservation,\" the TUUF questioned.\n\nThe
        chief minister \"ignored the crisis for weeks\" despite continuous protests,
        appeals and institutional paralysis, the forum alleged, adding that \"leadership
        demands timely engagement, not last-minute statements\".\n\n\"Our demands
        remain unchanged - immediate suspension of the current vice chancellor, pending
        enquiry, appointment of an acting vice chancellor - not a pro-VC and publication
        of all inquiry reports already submitted to authorities,\" the TUUF added.\n\nGogoi
        has also expressed his ''disappointment'' with the chief minister''s stand
        on the issues.\n\n\"Real leadership would have meant that the chief minister
        would have stood with the faculty, staff and students of this prestigious
        university. Instead, the chief minister is masking the failures of the current
        vice chancellor by suggesting a pro vice chancellor,\" he said in a post on
        X on Thursday.\n\nCiting old news reports, Gogoi claimed that there were \"enquiries
        about financial irregularities from the office of Principal Accountant General\"
        during Singh''s term as VC of Patna University in Bihar.\n\n\"It would be
        best that the prestige of Tezpur University should be paramount, and a new
        Vice Chancellor be appointed. Stop using the University of Northeast for posting
        controversial VCs,\" the Congress deputy leader in the Lok Sabha added.\n\nAll
        end-term examinations have been cancelled, and other activities have also
        stopped in the varsity.\n\nThe Tezpur University Teachers'' Association (TUTA)
        and Tezpur University Non-Teaching Employees'' Association (TUNTEA) have extended
        their support to the agitation.\n\nThe VC abstained from the campus after
        the university had witnessed noisy scenes and an exchange of words between
        him and students on September 22, leading to a situation where Singh had to
        leave the spot. PTI SSG BDC", "source":{"uri":"newsdrum.in", "dataType":"news",

        Trojan", "body":"Senior forward Ezra Ausar didn''t attempt a field goal in
        the first half but resurrected his game to finish with 13. He is pictured
        at a Nov. 15 game. (Braden Dawson \/ Daily Trojan)\n\nA camera panning to
        Eric Musselman with five minutes remaining in Tuesday''s bout with Oregon
        revealed an unfamiliar sight: the USC head coach, known for his in-game intensity,
        wiping away tears of joy courtside.\n\nMusselman''s reaction followed an impressive
        maneuver by senior forward Ezra Ausar, wherein he bounced the ball off Oregon
        junior forward Kwame Evans to keep the Trojans on offense, just one of USC''s
        gritty triumphs in an 82-77 win over the Ducks (4-4, 0-1 Big Ten). The No.
        24 Trojans (8-0, 1-0) were propelled by a mid-game surge to win their first
        true road game of the season.\n\nDespite offseason concerns about an almost
        entirely new roster, Musselman''s revamp has proved successful thus far. The
        Trojans are 8-0 for the first time since 2016, have already captured a Southwest
        Maui Invitational win and boast the Big Ten''s second-highest producing offense.\n\n\"I''m
        super impressed with our ability to win close games,\" Musselman said in a
        postgame news conference. \"We''re having limited bodies, but ... I''m super
        impressed with guys stepping up when their name is called.\"\n\nSenior guard
        Chad Baker-Mazara continued his prolific campaign, shooting 50% from the field
        in a 25-point effort, his fourth outing with more than 20 points this season.
        Five USC players, Baker-Mazara, sophomore forward Jacob Cofie, Ausar, graduate
        forward Jaden Brownell and freshman guard Jerry Easter II, managed double
        digits on the night.\n\nThe first half of Tuesday''s game saw the Ducks dictate
        the pace. Efforts from Cofie and Baker-Mazara kept the Trojans within reach,
        but Oregon''s success from beyond the arc -- 43% on the day -- gave them a
        10-point lead with five minutes remaining in the period.\n\nA 14-2 USC run,
        which included six consecutive points from Cofie, pulled the Trojans ahead
        briefly, before Oregon tied it up at 39 just before the half.\n\nCofie stood
        out on both ends, notching 17 points alongside four rebounds and three steals.
        Graduate guard Ryan Cornish scored his first points of the year, playing a
        season-high 15 minutes, and Brownell also impressed, tallying 11 points and
        three rebounds.\n\nEven without junior guard Rodney Rice, who suffered an
        upper-arm injury against Seton Hall University (8-1) last week, the Trojans
        maintained their resolve. His absence was eased by a strong performance from
        Easter II, who posted a career-high 11 points in his first start of the season.\n\nOregon
        was similarly subdued by injury. Ducks senior center Nate Bittle was forced
        to sit out after suffering a twisted ankle against San Diego State University
        (4-3) last week. Bittle is the Ducks'' primary facilitator, averaging nearly
        eight rebounds per game this year. The Trojans sized up well against the Ducks
        without Bittle, securing 35 rebounds against Oregon''s middling 27.\n\nUSC''s
        upswing before the break carried over into the second half, where the Trojans
        led for 11 straight minutes.\n\nAusar, who didn''t attempt a field goal in
        the first half, resurrected early in the second, totaling 13 points and nine
        rebounds. Despite four missed free throws, his ability to draw contact in
        the paint at pivotal moments was paramount to USC''s steady handle on its
        lead.\n\nHis two successful free throws with 10 minutes remaining grew the
        Trojan lead to six, their biggest advantage to that point. With eight minutes
        left, Oregon mustered a one-point advantage that was quickly squashed by a
        3-point jumper from Ausar.\n\nDown the stretch, Oregon tried, nearly successfully,
        to erase USC''s marginal lead, but Baker-Mazara''s stepback trey with just
        over a minute remaining extended the Trojans'' edge to six, effectively ending
        the Ducks'' comeback bid.\n\n\"As the game wore on, we settled into who we
        really are,\" Musselman said in a postgame news conference. \"We outrebounded
        Oregon, which was one of our themes going into the game.\"", "source":{"uri":"dailytrojan.com",

        Coupang faces possibility of record fine over massive data breach\n\nSEOUL
        -- Coupang Inc. faces the possibility of a record fine by the data protection
        regulator after the New York-listed e-commerce giant suffered a massive breach
        of customer information, according to industry sources Thursday.\n\nThe Personal
        Information Protection Commission (PIPC) has vowed stern action after Coupang
        said last week that the personal information of 33.7 million customers had
        been compromised, raising questions about the size of the fine the company
        could face.\n\nSEOUL -- President Lee Jae Myung is set to meet Japanese internet
        giant SoftBank Group''s founder and CEO Masayoshi Son later this week to discuss
        cooperation in artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductors and infrastructure
        investment, Lee''s office said Thursday.\n\nThe meeting, slated for Friday,
        comes as Lee has pledged to ramp up support for the AI industry as part of
        his goal to make South Korea one of the world''s top three AI powerhouses.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.yna.co.kr\/view\/AEN20251204006100315?section=national\/politics\n\n-----------------\n\n\u25a0

        -- South Korea''s media watchdog said Thursday it will launch a fact-finding
        probe into e-commerce giant Coupang Inc. over allegations that the company
        made its account deletion procedure deliberately complex, following a massive
        data breach.\n\nThe Korea Media Communications Commission (KMCC) said it will
        examine whether Coupang''s current account deletion procedure violates the
        Telecommunications Business Act, which prohibits service providers from restricting
        users'' rights to cancel or terminate their accounts.\n\n\u25a0 Senior diplomat

        President sees potential for $100,000 Bitcoin, but expects volatility.\n\nSummarize
        the content using AI\n\nChatGPT\n\nGrok\n\nDuring the Binance Blockchain Week,
        Ripple $2 CEO Brad Garlinghouse forecasted a remarkable ascent for Bitcoin
        $92,985 by the end of 2026, expecting it to hit $180,000. Meanwhile, Binance
        CEO Richard Teng, who was also present, avoided setting a price target, instead
        focusing on long-term growth. Additionally, Solana $144 Foundation''s President
        Lily Liu speculated that Bitcoin would trade above $100,000. Currently, the
        largest cryptocurrency is valued at around $93,000, significantly below its
        record high of $126,000 from just two months ago.\n\nContentsBrad Garlinghouse''s
        Bold Price ForecastDiverse Perspectives from Crypto Leaders Brad Garlinghouse''s
        Bold Price Forecast\n\nAt the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, Brad Garlinghouse
        expressed confidence that Bitcoin would experience a robust upward trend within
        the next two years. The Ripple CEO attributed this anticipated growth to factors
        such as global inflationary pressures, rising institutional interest, and
        the introduction of new ETFs in the market. His prediction of $180,000 reflects
        his strong belief in the market''s potential.\n\nAccording to Garlinghouse,
        Bitcoin is poised to become more than a mere investment vehicle by 2026, assuming
        a more prominent role in the global financial system. He emphasized that as
        blockchain technology matures, investors'' perspectives on cryptocurrencies
        are evolving. Consequently, he projected that Bitcoin will feature more prominently
        on corporate balance sheets, reinforcing its status as digital gold.\n\nDiverse
        Perspectives from Crypto Leaders\n\nIn the same panel, Binance CEO Richard
        Teng refrained from sharing any price predictions, underlining his commitment
        to long-term strategies. Teng stated that the market is still in its early
        stages, with his primary focus being steady growth and regulatory compliance.
        He stressed the importance of strengthening technology and user trust over
        reacting to short-term market fluctuations.\n\nSolana Foundation''s President
        Lily Liu offered a more cautious outlook. She acknowledged the possibility
        of Bitcoin surpassing the $100,000 threshold by 2026 but warned of continued
        high volatility. Liu pointed out that recovery signals in the market and new
        capital inflows into the ecosystem will be pivotal factors supporting Bitcoin''s
        mid-term performance.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter
