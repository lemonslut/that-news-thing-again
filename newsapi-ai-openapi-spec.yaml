      summary: Train a topic (concepts and categories) based on tweets matching your search filter
      description : >
          You can train a definition of a topic by analyzing the tweets that match a particular search filter. The collection of tweets
          that will be analyzed can be identified based on a Twitter username, a hashtag or a regular keyword. The chosen number of tweets
          matching the criteria will be identified and analyzed by identifying the concepts mentioned in them and the content will be categorizer.
          In addition to analyzing the content of the tweets, the articles linked in the tweets will also be analyzed and information will be
          extracted from them in the same way. The concepts and categories that will be found more commonly in the tweets will receive a higher weight in
          your final topic. Once the topic is trained, you can use the endpoint `/trainTopic` with `action=getTrainedTopic` and your topic `uri` to
          retrieve the topic definition.

      summary: Train a topic (concepts and categories) using your own documents
      description : >
        The API endpoint can be used to train a definition of a topic by analyzing several documents that you can provide. The
        documents will be annotated and categorized and the topic will be then defined by identifying commonly mentioned concepts and categories.
        The concepts and categories that will be found more commonly in your documents will receive a higher weight in your topic.


        Training of the topic can be done in several steps, which are triggered based on the specified `action` parameter. The initial step has
        to be a call with `action = createTopic`. In the response you will receive a `uri` parameter that has to be specified in the followup calls.


        In order to add documents to the topic specify `action = addDocument`. The topic will be finished once you call the endpoint with `action = finishTraining`.
        At that time, the returned information will also include the `topic` property containing the trained topic.


        If you wish to retrieve the topic at some later point, you can retrieve it again by using `action = getTrainedTopic`.

      summary: Obtain articles that match one or more search conditions
      description: |
        Identify the news articles that match a certain set of search criteria.

        The search conditions can be specified by setting the `query` parameter, or by specifying one or multiple search parameters, such as
        `keyword`, `conceptUri`, `sourceUri`, etc. To remove some of the results matching the *positive* conditions, you can specify some
        *negative* conditions using `ignoreKeyword`, `ignoreSourceUri`, and other `ignore*` parameters.

        The results of the search can be the list of matching articles (when `resultType = articles`) or one of the various aggregates (summaries) of the
        matching articles. In case of `resultType = timeAggr`, for example, the returned data will contain information *when* were the articles matching
        the search criteria published.

        Examples of use are provided on the **[examples page](https://eventregistry.org/documentation/examples#event-registry-api-examples-articles-get-articles)**. Details about the returned information is available on the **[data model page](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/wiki/Data-models)**.

      summary: Obtain articles that match a user generated topic page
      description: >
        Retrieve the news articles that match the topic page that the user generated on the [monitoring page](https://eventregistry.org/monitoring).


        The topic page has to be created using the web interface and can be defined by a list of concepts, keywords, news sources, categories and other available conditions.
        Each topic page has a unique id, called a URI. When you open the topic page, the URI is displayed in the url in the browser. Use that URI as the `uri` parameter when making the API calls.


        Compared to the `getArticles` endpoint, this endpoint is well suited when you want to find articles that match a broader topic that can be defined using a set of
        concepts and keywords. These concepts and keywords don't all need to be mentioned in an article, but the more of them are mentioned, the higher will the article be in the list of
        results. By default, the returned articles are sorted based on how well they match the topic, but you can also change the sorting by setting the `articlesSortBy` parameter.


        The results of the search can be the list of matching articles (when `resultType = articles`, default) or one of the various aggregates (summaries) of the
        matching articles. In case of `resultType = timeAggr`, for example, the returned data will contain information *when* were the articles matching
        the topic were published.


        Details about the returned information is available on the **[data model page](https://github.com/EventRegistry/event-registry-python/wiki/Data-models)**.

        The API endpoint allows the user to obtain the full list of news articles added to Event Registry in the last minute. This is the only
        API call that also allows returning more than 100 articles per call. If more than 100 articles are returned, then correspondingly higher number
        of tokens are used per call.

        Without any additional filters, the API will return 100 articles added in the last minute. By specifying filters like `lang`, `keyword`, `conceptUri`
        and others, you can however limit the recently added content to only the subset that matches these filters.

            you require. Specifying the parameter(s) will only return articles that were added since the articles with the provided URI were added. If you are repeatedly calling the endpoint, using this parameter is the best way to ensure
            that all matching content is retrieved.

        Identify the world events that match a certain set of search criteria.

        The search conditions can be specified by setting the `query` parameter, or by specifying one or multiple search parameters, such as
        `keyword`, `conceptUri`, `sourceUri`, etc. To remove some of the results matching the *positive* conditions, you can specify some
        *negative* conditions using `ignoreKeyword`, `ignoreSourceUri`, and other `ignore*` parameters.

        The results of the search can be the list of matching events (when `resultType = events`) or one of the various aggregates (summaries) of the
        matching events. In case of `resultType = locAggr`, for example, the returned data will contain the geographic locations where the
        events matching criteria occured.

      summary: Obtain events that match a user generated topic page
      description: >
        Retrieve the events that match the topic page the user generated on the [monitoring page](https://eventregistry.org/monitoring).


        The topic page has to be created using the web interface and can be defined by a list of concepts, keywords, news sources, categories and other available conditions.
        Each topic page has a uniqe id, called a URI. When you open the topic page, the URI is displayed in the url in the browser. Use that URI as the `uri` parameter when making the API calls.


        Compared to the `getEvents` endpoint, this endpoint is well suited when you want to find events that match a broader topic that can be defined using a set of
        concepts and keywords. These concepts and keywords don't all need to be mentioned in an event, but the more of them are mentioned, the higher will the event be in the list of
        results. By default, the returned events are sorted based on how well they match the topic, but you can also change the sorting by setting the `eventsSortBy` parameter.


        The results of the search can be the list of matching events (when `resultType = events`, default) or one of the various aggregates (summaries) of the
        matching events. In case of `resultType = timeAggr`, for example, the returned data will contain information *when* the matching events occurred.

      summary: Obtain details about a single event
      description: |
        The endpoint can be used to retrieve detailed information about a single event of interest. The event of interest should be
        provided with the `eventUri` parameter.

        For each event you can retrieve multiple properties. The most common is retrieving the list of articles that discuss the event. Alternatively,
        you can also generate various summaries, by using some other `returnType` value. The `keywordAggr` return type will, for example, return the top
        keywords that are mentioned in the articles about the event.

        If you would like retrieve only a subset of articles assigned to the event, you can do so by specifying one of the available filters
        (`keyword`, `conceptUri`, etc.).

        Examples of use are provided on the **[examples page](https://eventregistry.org/documentation/examples#event-registry-api-examples-events-get-event)**.

      summary: The stream of events that were added or updated in the last minute
      description: |
        The API endpoint allows the user to obtain the full list of events that were added or updated in Event Registry in the last minute.
        This is the only API call that also allows returning more than 50 events per call. If more than 50 events are returned,
        then correspondingly higher number of tokens are used per call.

        Without any additional filters, the API will return *all* events added/updated in the last minute. By specifying filters like
        `lang`, `keyword`, `conceptUri` and others, you can however limit the returned content to only the subset that matches these filters.

        Examples of use are provided on the **[examples page](https://eventregistry.org/documentation/examples#event-registry-api-examples-events-minute-stream-events)**.

      description: >
        Use the API to map the author name to the author URI that can be used when specifying the `authorUri` filter in
        various API calls. Since it's possible that there are multiple authors with the same name you can also specify the source domain name in the
        query (e.g. 'amy more nytimes.com') to make sure that the returned author will come from the news source of interest.
        The returned value will contain an array of author candidates that match the input name.
        The returned list is sorted based on the number of articles that we have collected from the author.
